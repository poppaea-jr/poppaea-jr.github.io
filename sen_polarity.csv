"I'm trying to teach myself options trading (mostly selling) but I find the terminology very difficult. I've spent months here trying to discern the gain/loss porn posted here and it still takes me awhile to figure it out. Those of you that do it successfully, how did you get started? None of my friends are interested in learning with me and I don't know where to look for a mentor. My portfolio (225k CAD) is doing okay but I can't help but think that with the same amount of capital I can potentially earn much more trading options than holding shares.",2022-01-04 16:43:00,0.19444444444444445
"As this is asked frequently in different subs I thought I put it here for further reference.

First of all: **do not invest on margin** if you don't understand exactly what you are doing. It is very dangerous and you have to control the risk.

Now to control the risk you cannot rely on your broker. Some brokers will issue a margin call, others will just start to liquidate your positions when your equity goes down. Don't let this happen, control the risk yourself and act yourself before the broker does.

First you define how much you want to invest on margin. Say you want to take a loan of 20% then your  are at 120%. Then define a maximum level before you start liquidating your positions yourself. This multiple must be lower than the maximum your broker would give you. Say you declare this to be 300% (which is quiet high, but some brokers even give you 800% or more with portfolio margin).

The formula which you can use in a spreadsheet should tell you to which level the value of your portfolio may tank before you have to take action. This is the formula:

D=Debt

Mmax=maximum margin before you have to act

Vmin=minimum value your positions may fall to

V=actual value

ST=Stress tolerance. That much your positions may lose before you have to act.

Vmin=D\*Mmax/(Mmax-100%)

ST=(V-Vmin)/V

Sorry, I'm no mathematician. I use those formulas in spreadsheets to control my risk in strategies with margin. The most important number is Vmin. Whenever the value of your stocks comes near that or even under that number you have to take action, say close positions.

Example: you have 100'000 and want to invest 120% on margin. You want to get out at 300% margin.

Vmin=20000\*300/(300-100) = 30000

ST=(120000-30000)/120000 = 75%

You have a stress tolerance of 75%. Bare in mind that in this example you lose 90% of your capital before you have to take action! Without margin you can lose close to 100% without having to take action and therefore have a stress tolerance of almost 100% (the broker probably would close your account if all your holdings go to zero and there is no cash left...).",2022-01-04 16:42:29,0.08041062801932368

"American manufacturers in December matched their slowest pace of growth in 11 months as they coped with persistent labor and material shortages and braced for a fresh onslaught from the omicron strain of the coronavirus. 

A closely followed index of U.S.-based manufacturers dropped to 58.7% in the final month of 2021 compared to 61.1% in November, the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday. Any number above 50% signals expansion and readings above 60% are considered exceptional.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to slip to 60%.

The ISM results are drawn from a survey of senior business executives. The index tends to give a good snapshot of the health of the U.S. economy. 

**Big picture:** Manufacturers have plenty of demand for new cars, electronics, furniture and the like, but they are likely to remain under strain until all the shortages ease up.

Omicron doesn’t help matters. The very contagious strain is likely to make it harder for manufacturers to keep production lines going at full tilt due to employees missing work after catching the virus. Yet they have been less affected by the coronavirus than businesses that deal with customers face to face.

"I am currently building a database in excel to create an ARIMA model in RStudio to make forecasts for stock prices and the beta values of certain variables (to know what to look out for) and I consider that for many stocks inflation is an important factor, however, stock prices and all other variables I have chosen are published daily but the CPI is published monthly and the most recent data is from November 2021 (this screws up my whole model). I really don't want to ignore inflation completely since I want my model to have the highest R-Squared possible. I did a little research on daily indicators that mirror inflation and the closest I could find was the IQ Real Return Index (an etf) but the stated purpose of the index is to provide a real return above the inflation rate so I guess that its not the optimal variable to use here.

"Stocks is obviously a risk. You can alot depending on a company's performance. You can earn lesser amount of money for a safer long term investment but that too is risky in case company suddenly has to face some problems and they have to declare bankruptcy. 

So my fear and question is how do people choose which company to invest in for long term without worrying if that company will go bankrupt, And totally dissolve and disappear? 

For example Chrysler went bankrupt and it was saved by fiat. So it didn't dissolve. Conseco managed to get out of bankruptcy. Etc.

"I know posts like these are common but at this point I need a fresh set of eyes, perspective, and knowledge to help me make a better decision. 

I recently opened a SEP IRA with Vanguard and am considering my options for 2022. I have been historically investing in ETF's for a few years now, particularly, VOO and some VONG in the past year. Initially, my intention was to buy $58k worth of VOOG or VONG and just forget it but after missing on some gains in 2021, I've been considering investing in individual stocks rather than index investing as well.  

I refuse to buy any speculative plays with this money and so I have narrowed down to a few individual stocks that I feel will continue to grow into the future (not just 2022) and would appreciate all and ay input. I'm going to start with the big three, of course. 

1. AAPL: seems like a very safe play. There is a potential, new, smaller iPhone coming out and with their foray into processors recently they have been on fire. I don't think AAPL is going anywhere anytime soon but I am a little worried about their lack of expansion into more of the cloud computing space, than, say, MSFT or others. 
2. MSFT: I think I remember when this stock was $50 something dollars... However, I am having a hard time purchasing it at $330 something right now. I don't believe it is overvalued but the price growth makes me cautious. Regardless, I would buy and hold this even at these levels. 
3. GOOG: I haven't looked too much into but this GOOG seems like a very safe bet as well, however, besides ""expert"" ratings, I really haven't looked too much into it. frankly, I've been a little anti- google for years but can't ignore that this is a great play. 

Others that I am considering and would like some input on:

ASML, and TSM - did someone say chip shortage? they just had a fire at one of their factories (I think damage is minimal) but this seems like a great stock to hold and buy long term, however, TSM seems a lot more attractive and cheaper at $130 something. I do believe they are one of the few, larger, compnies that have capabilities to manufacture chips and are in a great position to grow with AMD, NVDA and others' thirst for semiconductors.

&#x200B;

Others: CRM, NET, CRWD, PANW, MRVL similar as above. I've done some research on these stocks and while PANW seems like a very bet I would like some input on the rest of these. 

RNG- this one, I have no idea. They've lost so much in the last year, yet, it a ""strong buy"" everywhere. I don't think the stock will bounce back soon but I could be completely wrong here.

I've been reading about DCA vs lump sump buying and would, ideally, like to invest it all in one stock but am open to ideas. In the grand scheme of things, $58k really isnt much, therefore would like to invest it in one stock.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

"I have a couple of nieces/nephews coming into the world soon and would like to buy them stocks that will be gifted to them at the age of 25. I'm planning on doing 5k each. My plan is to do 4k eft's and 1k in something riskier. After seeing what Apple accomplished in a little over 30 years, I think it would be a fun bet without much of a consequence if it all went to one company that isn't huge yet. I'm not expecting to find the next Apple and I understand less accomplished companies are riskier, but it's a risk I'm happy to take. I'm not great at research and dd when it comes to stocks, my personal portfolio is relatively safe I think, made up of etf's, aapl, msft, and my dumbest risk (that paid off) was tsla. I'm content with my holdings and they are long term as well (at least 10 more years). But I want to do something fun with a bit of risk for my new family members! Any suggestions?",2022-01-04 07:45:08,0.16479377104377105

"Hello everyone, 

Recently graduated college and started my career, created a Roth IRA account a couple of days ago. Was trying to get some ideas on what are the best dividends stocks to currently buy or to look out for (I will be setting this up so all dividends are DRIP)

"Hello everyone! I am currently a high school senior who has pretty much devoted his entire last 2 years to studying the markets. I want to conduct some research but I’m not sure what would be a good idea to start with first. I am currently taking a look at all 2020 and 2021 openings and closing for each month in the major index’s to notice patterns that could potentially help me with the 2022 year. I am also looking at the 10 year yield to see the correlation between them. 

If anyone has ANY ideas please let me know. I am enthralled by the markets and want to get much deeper into the analysis of the markets as a whole. 


TLDR: Need something to research. Please leave suggestions below.",2022-01-04 06:38:05,0.13634615384615384

"I have been reading up on options trading and I was looking into selling covered calls. I was wanting to make sure I understand the potential risks correctly.

So let's say I hold 100 shares of XYZ company for $25/share. I want to sell a covered call for, let's say a week out. I put a strike price of $27/share and let's say the options are $0.15 each. I only have 100 shares so I sell one contract and gain $15 (minus any fees). If the share price does not exceed $27 by expiration, the call is highly unlikely to be exercised by the buyer so I essentially profit the $15 (minus fees) that I earned selling the option.

Now if the price goes up to, let's say, $28/share, the call is likely to be exercised, and I'm forced to sell my 100 shares for $27/each. In this scenario, I have gained the $15 premium (minus fees), but now I've also sold for $2 profit per share for an additional $200, but the risk here is I missed out on potentially another $100 if I had not sold the options to begin with. While this limits the profit made on the shares themselves, it's also not necessarily bad because I didn't lose any capital, either.

And finally, let's say the share price goes down to $22/share. The call is extremely unlikely to be exercised and I just pocketed the premium for selling the call. But, if for some weird reason the call gets exercised, it's not bad because I just sold the shares for $27 each when they are only trading at $22 each now. Obviously highly unlikely the call would be exercised, but just wanted to throw this scenario in just to make sure I understand all possibilities.

And, regardless of any other scenario, if I buy back the option I sold before expiration and before it was exercised, I basically pay the current market value, which ideally is less than what I initially sold it for, so I still pocket some money, but not quite the full initial premium.

Is all the above correct? And am I missing anything that I should know before diving into it?

And another question about actually selling the contract. If I only own 100 shares, obviously I can only ""afford"" to have one call exercised. Would this stop me from potentially selling multiple options, maybe 1 per week or month, and if one were to get exercised I would just close out the remainder? Or am I only allowed to have one ""active"" contract per 100 shares I earn, preventing me from selling another with a different expiration if I already have one out?

Thank you in advance!",2022-01-04 04:23:21,-0.01873219373219374

"I am timid of TSLA and NVDA, although they seem to be the premiere securities of this time. I am aware of stocks like VISA selling at a discount. COST seems like a safe investment with ample opportunity. This is the stock I will probably begin to analyze in contrast to companies like Walmart and Target.

"I'm planning on opening a roth and basically I'm wondering where I can open it to have access to things like trusts that the broker for my regular brokerage account doesn't offer. I'm especially interested in things like things like the trusts that are commonly used in the UK, but I don't know if those are available to Americans with roths. Where can I get the most flexibility? 

I already have a 401k and a regular IRA so I'd really like to open a roth someplace that I can get exposure to some different assets than regular target retirement accounts and indexes.",2022-01-04 03:40:41,0.11818181818181818
"AAPL is 6.7% of my portfolio. My cost basis is $103 a share.  I now have a 76% gain in AAPL .

MSFT is now 9.4% of portfolio. Cost basis $211. 

The shares are mostly long so I could trim.

I know most say ""let your winners ride"", but isn't part of a winning long term strategy to sell when at all time highs or at least trim?

A lot of people including Tom Lee think that the first half of 2022 is gonna get ""rough"" and that ""mega caps will lead a 10% correction most likely"".

Doesn't it make sense to trim a little off my mega cap names and buy in lower if we do correct?

I mean AAPL is now at $180+.  It wouldn't be that difficult I would think to sell a few shares now and hold for a few months in cash and but back in at $160 or something correct?

The same could be said for MSFT and maybe even my GOOGL?

Just trying to do what's smart.

Put together an educational video series using youtube videos. Organized the videos into a course that starts with the most basic investing concepts designed for someone that doesn't even know what a stock is and progresses to more advanced and complex topic such as fundamental analysis, and portfolio diversification. Hopefully people find this useful. Did this for all of the people in rl asking me to teach them to invest, so I created this course so they can teach themselves. Now sharing with the internet.

The link is to my Google Drive where I host the course. Will update and add to this regularly, check back for changes.
