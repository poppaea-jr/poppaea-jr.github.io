0,2022-01-08 14:30:12,"When does WCLD start looking attractive again?If you're not familiar with WCLD, it's a cloud computing ETF that was a pretty popular suggestion on here for a while, and like so many other things it made a pretty nice run from about March 2020. However, it's filled with the kind of small and mid-cap growth stocks that are getting crushed right now, and it's given back about half those gains since October.

I'm thinking about what growth stocks to maybe buy during this correction, and the argument for this ETF is the same as it was before (cloud computing is the future, it's harder to pick individual winners than a winning sector, etc.), so I'm watching it and seriously considering it. Anyone want to talk me out of it? Does it have way farther to fall? Are MSFT/AMZN/GOOG going to dominate so much that there's no point picking the little guys?"

Europoor here. One of my countrie's retirement schemes has funds which track SP500 and sadly it feels like currently we are purchasing at the peak. Now I believe time in market is key, but do you guys feel its safe to currently be contributing towards the SP500? 

Would it be safer to currently allocate some assets into index-linked bonds, alternatives and commodoties to hedge against inflation?

Thanks!"
2,2022-01-08 14:21:46,"Stocks to pick in current Macro environmentI would like some suggestions for me to do some analysis. This year have been dreadful for me and my portfolio. I have always invested in hyper growth/growth companies with a good business. It always worked until it did not. I have only been in the market 4-5 years and I am never experienced current macro environment. I ended up buying dips on my holding which dipped another 30-40 percent and it devastated my portfolio. I started the year around 225k now I am down to 60k. I am still holding some companies I truly believe in but realized losses to free some cash.

Now I am looking to pick some stocks that suits current macro environment and can offer some upsides. I am starting to look at some low valuation companies. So far I like some bio tech companies i.e. MRK PFE CCXI & other stocks like VALE VIAC. What will be your suggestion? Thank you"
3,2022-01-08 13:50:34,"New portfolio advice!Hi r/stocks, as a new investor (not trader) I am planning to start my new portfolio and I would like your advice on percentages I’d like to buy. Just to see if I am on a good track and what can be done better. 
I am 29 and plan to invest this money for at least 10 years.

I mostly plan to invest in companies that I believe will grow.

Also I would like an advice where to put money each month. Should I just keep with the percentages of inicial investment? Or focus on putting more money on ETF and leave the rest as it is? 

Just to mention that I already have some stocks of FB, NVDA,AMD. This was really small investment, just to see how the market works and to get into it. I just plan to leave those as they are, and focus bigger money on next portfolio:

VOO 15%

QQQ 15%

PHO or SMOG 5% (water or low carbon etf, not sure which to choose, I think water one is better, but haven’t done proper comparation, just feeling) 

BRK.B 10%
AMZN 10%
GOOG 10%
MSFT 10%
TSLA 7.5%
AAPL 7.5%

VISA OR MC 5% (also not sure which one to chose but I am more for Visa)

NIO 2.5%
ENPH 2.5%

My plan is to start with $10.000 and spreading them in between these ETF’s and stocks, then adding more funds each month. 
Would you recommend some different percentages and why? Maybe some other stocks or ETF’s? Where to place monthly funds? 

Thank you for your help and don’t forget, buy high sell low xd"
4,2022-01-08 13:17:11,"This killed day trading for me..I haven't told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about.  I had started day trading paper stocks. I was reading day trading books by reputable day traders, watching live YouTube traders and actually was doing pretty good. In 1 year, I had turned the original 10,000 paper money I started with into 140,000. It was like I couldn't lose. For every red day, I had 3 green days. I was doing everything by the book and it was really working.  
   
   So, not having any money, I took out a personal loan for 5k. Put 2k in the bank and 3k into my day trading platform. I was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me 5 years at 23%. I told him I'd pay it off in full within 6 months. 

   Now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst. A reason why a stock will go up. They also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than 5% so you don't lose everything if it drops. Well I started day trading for real and was doing only ok. I would make 250 dollars then lose 150 dollars. Lose 300 then make 200. I was about 50/50 red days and green days. My 3k was down to about 2,800 after a week. Then it happened.  I read a stock twit at 5am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on Amazon. I looked it up and it was true. I told myself I would buy 2k worth. When I looked up the price, it was only .88 a share!

   The bell rings and I buy like 2,200 shares. It instantly goes up about 6 percent and I'm getting excited. Then, literally as I'm setting my stop loss (not even 2 minutes into the session) it drops. Alot. Below where my stop was gonna be set. I'm down 100 so I'm like we'll shit. I go to set another stop but it falls so fast that I can't set it in time. I'm down 200 then 300 then 400 and I'm freaking out. I finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a 400 dollar loss. This was the first 5 minutes of the session. Over the next 20 minutes it dropped to .40 a share. I thought well at least I got out before it went that low. Upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news, I Ieft to work. I had about a 35 min drive and decided about 10 mins into it to check on that stock. It was 2.50 a share! The app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks, I could not perform any buy/sell action from the app and I was driving to work. I checked again 10 mins later, it was at 4.50 a share! I got to the supply house about 20 mins later and checked while I was waiting on parts. 7.00 a share. I couldn't stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at 12.35 a share I literally felt sick. The next day it fell a bit early but then ended at 17 dollars! 

   Over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of 34 dollars a share. Now I don't know if I would have held it to that point but I beat myself up for months thinking I lost 400 dollars when I could have made 60k. It completely killed my spirit. I started sucking at my trades. It only took a few months and another almost 2k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my 600 bucks I had left and put it in a different stock trading account, close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade.

   They say 84% of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year. I guess I was part of that statistic. I went from being on cloud 9 with my paper account for a year, just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months. Every time someone brings up ""yo man, you still doing the day trading thing"" I just lie and tell them no I don't have enough time to dedicate to it anymore. But really I think of the perfect trade that I knew would go up, that I sold for a loss and, unable to do anything, I watched it go up 3,500% and it still makes me physically queasy. This was 4 years ago. I am what they call in the business an emotional trader. Just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety. Thanks for reading my story. 100% true btw. Nothing in this is made up or exaggerated. Real prices, real time frames. I just can't remember the ticker. 
 
   It ended up falling to about 3 or 4 dollars a share over the next year, and yes I watched it for the next year but 2k into 26k in one day would have been great. 2k into 35k the next day would have been better.  Turning it into 60k would have been life changing for me at that time but I think what hurts the most is that I found that obscure twit. I did the research. I truly believed it would go up, I knew it would go up. Then I panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect. Thats worse than losing the money."

I'm a teenager who wants to start buying stocks and I have absolutely no clue on how to start nor do I have any related or prior knowledge (I'm highly doubting that a high school Econs class would get me far). From some of my peers that have started already, they said simulators such as Marketwatch would be helpful for me to start with. However, the overall mechanics was too confusing for me, and I really wanted to get started (I wanted to gain experience and learn about the real world and how it works)

8,2022-01-08 04:53:11,"What considerations do you make when deciding to buy back a covered call or keep it longer?I've been looking into selling covered calls lately and began with a relatively low cost stock, which also means not an enormous options volume (but still enough to play around with). I sold a 6-month covered call at a $110 premium (about 20% of the entire 100 stock's value), and figured I'd ride out the 6 months, or at least most of it to hopefully keep majority of the premium. However, after just a few days, I have the potential to buy it back to keep about $25 of that premium. I'm wondering if it's worth it to cash out and roll the dice on another one, or keep it a while longer to cash out on more. 

I'm trying to think about this in terms of how much profit I'm seeing vs. the amount of time spent. 5% profit on the entire initial cost of the stock seems pretty good for just a few days, and riding it out for potentially 6 months means up to 20% return on the total investment. 

Is this a good way of thinking about options? What goes through your mind to make the decision whether to ride it out longer or just cash out?"

However, it also doesn’t seem like a good time to buy puts because there is a possibility that the rate hikes and inflation have already been “priced in”. The sell off in growth and tech stocks could be seen as a correction that is due to bounce back. Also, I sincerely believe we have seen the worst of the pandemic and Covid will become a mild seasonal flu for those who have been vaccinated or have natural immunity. This happening as soon as this summer, which would cause a surge in the economy. There’s also a chance the Biden stimulus bill will get modified and passed by Congress - even a watered down version would provide a boost.

12,2022-01-08 02:00:58,"A thoughtful consideration of LCID from a laypersonI just closed this position so I feel it's worth going into my perception of LCID--the stock and company.  I still strongly believe in the company and I think the CEO is top tier.  In terms of product, leadership, and future (in EV's), I'd easily put Lucid at the top (and far above Tesla).  Second, the stock is fairly priced now so I don't think people will lose money long-term with it.  

So, why did I close my position?  The unrelated reason is I wanted the cash freed up for buying opportunities (and we're about to have a lot of them) and I don't see a ""rocketing"" of LCID any time soon.  That alone is not a good reason for anyone else to sell shares or close the position.  The company-related reason is that, while the fundamentals of the company remain strong, real world changes are making LCID less and less promising as an investment.  I think it'll still offer profit to investors, but it won't outpace the popular index funds.  Here are the factors that compelled me to close the position that relate to the company:

1. Interest rates rising (duh).  
2. A \*lot\* of shares that will be unlocked and potentially sold in the future.  This dilution will make the current fair-priced value drop, IMO.  Again, long-term profitability will be present, but nothing like what hopeful investors expect (again, IMO).
3. Competition is present.  This won't hurt them on the luxury EV front (I think they will stay the top choice for luxury EV's), but they need to expand to average consumers and I think that'll be a tough job.  There are a lot of competitors and likely to be even more in the future.
4. Anything related to green energy is going to be completely DOA as the democrats get completely wiped out of government.  Even with a majority, they barely moved the needle on green energy stocks or etfs (RIP ICLN).  With republicans all-but-guaranteed control over both branches of congress followed by a near certain presidential victory, they will have a super majority.  I don't see how this is favorable to Lucid, EVs, or anything green energy-related.  (Semi-related, I do wonder what good investments would be with republican leadership?  Banks and oil, I imagine.)
5. Consumer spending ability.  The dollar is worth less and less and most money has already been funneled upwards.  So, this again speaks to Lucid being fine as far as luxury EV's go, but there is very little growth potential as they look to the average consumer to buy their future ""average"" EV's.

I'd be very interested to hear others' opinions and analyses, but please no emotional reactions--good or bad.  Just your thoughtful consideration of the facts."

NIO market cap: $46 billion 

Typically these companies are burning $1 billion annually and with the amount of cash on hand for LUCID that leaves them 3 years before needing to raise more capital. NIO has a much more solid balance sheet and even positive free cash flows and it leaves about double the time.

LUCID had $700 million in revenue in 2021 vs NIO doing $1.5 billion  
LUCID sold about 577 vehicles and delivered ""several"" (i think about 24 someone correct me if I'm wrong)  and NIO sold over 80,000 while delivering 80,940.     
Neither seem to have any debt at the moment.

Just skimmed the facts here but how in the hell is LUCID valued 33% more than NIO? And how is it even valued at $69 billion. I understand the factories they are building and the potential for a ramp up, but burning through $1 billion in cash every year with little sales/cars delivered is insane. I know their projections are selling 20,000 in 2022 and 50,000 in 2023 but their chances look slim. Although the same was said for TESLA and look where they are now! NIO on the other hand has a very strong balance sheet and has a much greater likelihood of ""surviving."" Are most people afraid to touch NIO mainly because it is a chinease firm? I do also understand their manufacturer is state owned. But I just don't see this valuation for LUCID. 

If anyone has comments or sees anything off about my statement please feel free to comment! Would love to see others opinions.

22,2022-01-07 22:57:53,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, January 7, 2022 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, January 7, 2022**

Stocks closed the first week of 2022 in the red, the worst start to a year since 2016, as market participants continue to digest the December labor market and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes, which signaled participants favor an interest rate hike “relatively soon”. The Nasdaq (QQQ) suffered its worst week since February 2021.

**Notable Numbers**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.40%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.08%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.02%
* Russel 2000 (IWM): -1.16%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.33%
* 10yr Treasury Yield: 1.77%
* Tesla (TSLA): -3.54%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -3.32%
* Lucid Motors (LCID): +9.84%
* Discovery (DISCA): +16.87%
* Gamestop (GME): +7.32%

The Labor Department’s December jobs report released this morning showed the US added a disappointing 199,000 in December, coming in way below expectations and an unexpected slowdown compared to the previous month. 

Other metrics, however, were more upbeat, as the unemployment rate improved to a fresh pandemic-era low of 3.9%, and the labor force participation rate steadied after an upward revision in November. Still, many economists cautioned that a more recent hit to the labor market from the surge in Omicron cases may not yet have been. captured in the December report. 

By industry, some of the services-related sectors hardest-hit initially by the pandemic saw muted hiring at the end of December. Leisure and hospitality jobs rose by 53,000 in the last month of the year, rising compared to November's gain of 41,000, but coming in well below the 211,000 seen in October. 

Other industries saw a deceleration in hiring in December. Transportation and warehousing jobs rose by just under 19,000 during the month after a rise of more than 42,000 in November, while professional and business services positions rose by 43,000 after a gain of 72,000 during the prior month. Education and health services employment gains totaled 10,000, slowing from 14,000 in the prior period. Meanwhile, retail trade employers shed jobs for a back-to-back month. 

Here are the numbers:

* **Non-farm payrolls:** \+199,000 vs. +450,000 expected and a revised +249,000 in November
* **Unemployment rate:** 3.9% vs. 4.1% expected and 4.2% in November 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.4% expected and a revised 0.4% in November
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.7% vs. 4.2% expected and a revised 5.1% in November

Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor, said “It's a solid report. Obviously, it didn't hit what the experts had said ... but when you look at 2021 as a combined total, as the president has been sworn into office, passed the American Rescue Plan, 6.4 million jobs have been added, which is a record. There's no question that we still have people out of work, we have people that have left the workforce. We're working on also inflation,"" he added. ""So we do have some work to move forward.""

Coming into the December job report, stocks were already under pressure as market participants digested recent comments from the Federal Reserve, suggesting an interest rate hike could come “soon”. With policymakers closely watching for signs that the economy has reached maximum employment, the jobs report could provide additional fodder for the Fed to double down on its more hawkish tilt. 

In the latest meeting minutes, participants suggested they were inclined to further speed up the pace of tapering and accelerate the timeline to raise interest rates.

Mohamed El-Erian, President of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and Allianz Chief Economic Advisor said, “The way I view it is very simple: The Fed delivered a wonderful year for markets in 2021, at the cost of a much more complicated outlook in 2022. And that complicated outlook is for policy, is for the economy, and therefore is a more uncertain outlook for markets. This is still a very robust economy. If we avoid a policy mistake — big if. But if we avoid a policy mistake, this economy has all the ingredients to continue growing and grow in a more inclusive manner. But we do need help on labor force participation and productivity. We do need help on the supply side.”

**Highlights**

* After gapping up more than 30% yesterday after-hours, Gamestop (GME) was unable to hold onto most of the gains, finishing roughly 7% higher.
* A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived a 2019 shareholder lawsuit filed against Boeing Co (BA) after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people over a five-month period and led to the plane's 20-month grounding.
* Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) both suffered their worst single-week decline since the beginning of the pandemic, with shares falling -5.4% and -6.6% respectively.
* Mortgage rates rose to their highest level in more than a year and a half after details from the Federal Reserve's last policy-setting meeting released on Wednesday hardened expectations for a higher interest-rate environment.
* The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped from 3.11% to 3.22% this week, according to Freddie Mac. 
* The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that U.S. factory orders accelerated in November, climbing 1.6% during the month. 
* The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that November's read jumped to a near-record $80.2 billion, 19.3% higher than the October deficit of $67.2 billion and just below the all-time monthly record of $81.4 billion reported in September.

The data from everywhere shows the hospitalization rates and the mortality are much lower, and it is far more contagious. WHO reported last month that of the 38 countries where the strain was identified, none have registered specific deaths. So probably it will spread faster and will push out the other more deadly strains. And as the pandemics are above all social issue, the need of new vaccines, therapies and medicines related to covid will diminish."

yesterday we finished the day with a green doji candle. we could have went either way really today. historically speaking a doji after a dip usually resulted in a big green day. that absolutely didnt happen today. today we traded between the 20 day EMA and 50 EMA. Early morning we saw the test and rejection of the 20 ema. we shortly after saw the test and rejection of breaking the 50 ema which left us in limbo. 
we tried during power hour to gain any momentum to run up and was not able to get any green momentum. we found ourselves selling off heavily right at the end there dropping as low as 466 before we closed. We also have a confirmed daily and weekly sell on the MACD along with a bearish engulfing weekly candle. 

next week i expect a similar fate for us. i expect us to retest the support at the 50 ema which i suspect we will break easily at 464.5. from there we should continue this stair step down towards the final goal/ support at the 100 ema near 455. i suspect it to be closer to 456-457 by time we get there. i do find it rather healthy the way this sell off is happening. instead of wild -2%+ days we are slowly stair stepping down. i like it. 

one thing im watching here is that in general gaps are filled. however if this stair stepping is continued the gap will be below both the 100 ema and the support line. we could see a fast wic down to fill it and a hard bounce. but if that red dotted support line thats over 1.5 years old is broken. we very well could see an even more significant 10%+ from ATH dip. im not convinced thats the market sentiment though yet and will evaluate once there. 

im playing my puts till we break below 460 then i will be looking to sell them and find some longer dated calls. i of course still play the intraday options but for my long term thats my play. 

of course added a picture of my positons to show im not full of it.

I’m a 23 year old looking to start investing for the long-term future. I have about $30k I can safely invest without needing to see it again for decades. I am not knowledgeable about investing, and have no desire to spend hours regularly to buy/sell particular stocks/bonds/etc. (please let me know if you think this aversion is a big mistake). 

Given this, I have met with a financial advisor, who suggested I invest my money accordingly:

$7500 into each of DIA, SPY, QQQ, and VNQ. 

Do you believe this is a reasonable portfolio to have for long-term appreciation? This doesn’t include bonds or anything international, though I’m not sure how much that will matter given that I hope to hold this stuff for decades.

47,2022-01-07 15:55:48,"Hedge funds are selling tech shares at their fastest pace in a decadeSurging bond yields have triggered hedge funds to sell growth-focused technology shares at a speed not seen in the past decade. The hedge fund community dumped tech stocks in the four sessions between Dec. 30 and Tuesday as interest rates spiked. The four-session tech unloading marked the biggest sale in dollar terms in more than 10 years, reaching a record since Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage started tracking the data.

Tech stocks are seen as sensitive to rising yields because increased debt costs can hinder their growth and can make their future cash flows appear less valuable. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has sold off more than 3% this week, underperforming the S&P 500, which dipped 1% during the same period. The rate spike in the new year resumed Thursday, with investors assessing the Federal Reserve’s faster-than-expected policy tightening. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 1.75% during the session, rising for a fourth straight day. The benchmark rate ended 2021 at 1.51%.

Yields jumped after the Fed issued on Wednesday minutes from its last meeting, which showed the central bank could become even more aggressive than expected about raising interest rates and tightening policy. Goldman noted that hedge funds’ selling of tech stocks is driven almost entirely by long sales, in contrast to mainly short sales seen in the last two months of 2021. The selling was driven by software and semiconductor stocks, the Wall Street firm said.

49,2022-01-07 15:26:15,"$ACY, Aerocentury corp, an empty shell of grandiose promises.**I am short $ACY, and I think the company is worthless zero!**

&#x200B;

AeroCentury Corp is the NYSE listed skeleton of a post-bankruptcy aircraft leasing company bid over by a group of “ PRC Investors” for $11M. The new owners ambition on turning their new holding company into “the” leading player in the growing GameFi/Metaverse ecosystem. 

In essence, the Novel Aerocentury Corp, is a reverse merger that has enabled unknown opportunistic investors access into the NYSE, one of the world’s most liquid and dynamic financial markets at a time of extreme speculative exuberance.

&#x200B;

With a Mrkt Cap of $285M, the thinly traded Aerocentury Corp has no earnings, no sales, and no operating business of note. beside its recurrent press announcement of transitioning its business strategy into the up and coming Gamefi industry within the Metaverse ecosystem, very little actionable metric can be justifiably applied to explain its current valuation. 

First off, what is the Gamefi?

The GameFi can be interpreted as the combination of videos Games and decentralized finance. The technology used in this type of video game is blockchain; which allows players to be the sole and verified owners of the virtual elements of the game. Gamefi is built upon the play to earn model where players are able to earn money on time spent invested in the game. 

Gamefi is rapidly growing in popularity with large and well funded companies like Meta/Facebook tooting its futuristic and revolutionary potential. As recently as last summer, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the biggest and most storied Silicon Valley venture capital firms, invested $4.6M in a little known Philippine Gamefi company called YGG. YGG has grown to be a hugely important player in the Gamefi ecosystem. 

Giving the exciting opportunities presented by the Gamefi/metaverse revolution, it is obvious that hundreds of millions of dollars of investments are being poured into that ecosystem by various sized enterprises seeking to dominate it. And, dominating the Gamefi sector is Aerocentury Corp stated objective: 

**“ We are well positioned to become the leader in the Gamefi Industry. We have a WORLD CLASS TEAM with a proven track records of success,”**

                        Yucheng Hu, CEO of AeroCentury Corp.

Armed with a reverse merged stock shell, 8 employees, shadowy PRC based investors, the confidence displayed by Mr Hu as to the future dominant position of his company within the Gamefi industry is quite perplexing. Is his confident statement issued on the back of a proven track record in Gaming and related industries? Or, is Mr Hu a mere promoter seeking to excite the speculative crowd with boisterous statements aimed at selling his securities? 

Let’s investigate AeroCentury Corp “WORLD CLASS” team! 

\-**Hu YuCheng, CEO, largest shareholder.**

In his biograpgical presentation, Mr Hu claims to be a successful entrepreneur with over 15 years of experience in the Internet industry. He is the founder of chengdu Quleduo Technology co and has served as its CEO since 2011.

 He has established the Xiyou Online Mobile game platform ( [www.52xiyou.com),](http://www.52xiyou.com%29%2C/) which is a popular online gaming platform in the PRC.

My research unto Mr Hu “successful” ventures have been quite contradictory to say the least.

The “Chengdu Quleduo Tech” website links into GMGC ( Global Mobile Game Confederation). The website appears inactive or dormant as its last update occurred in 2018. GMGC describes itself as a platform founded in 2012 in Beijing by David Song, a gaming entrepreneur. GMGC organizes the annual Global Mobile Gaming congress in Beijing as well as events in Kunshan and Chengdu. GMGC also host a series of conference in South East Asia and offers exclusive membership services as well. 

On the other hand, Quleduo Tech is listed as a private company incorporated in Hong Kong in April 2016 per Hong Kong business directory.

Quleduo tech claims to be dedicated to the development of web based and smartphone video games of the highest quality. Its only attested Game is titled “ Ultra Fighters”, and it was removed from the App Store and listed on Google play by a different developer: “ Funmore Technology Company Limited.”

The reviews on Ultra Fighters tend to fall within the context of:

\-“ Can’t connect to the updated server. Unplayable. Hasn’t been updated since 2018. Remove this from the Play store.” 1star review. 7/16/2021.

\-”It just won’t work instead it keeps showing a notice like cannot connect to a update server. I was looking forward to play it but i am disappointed.” 1star review 10/03/2018.

Looking into [www.52xiyou.com,](http://www.52xiyou.com%2C/) the website heralded as a popular online gaming platform in the PRC by Mr Hu, I was intrigued by a comment made in a forum regarding the site:

“It looks like a random Chinese website stealing POE ( Path of exile) gameplay footage as advertising material. The lines that appear are generic advertising like “ Great Graphics” and amazing play experience. 52xiyou.com does appears to fall well below the standards of a serious and popular gaming platform. 

Consequently, Mr Yucheng Hu statements regarding his long string of successful businesses are rather questionable and probably deceitful. On the other hand, he indeed appears to be more of a bombastic promoter than a real entrepreneur. It is quite unlikely that such a individual will be able to lead a company at the top of a nascent and extremely competitive industry as the GameFi. 

**-Ms Florence Ng, VP of operation and Business development.**

Ms. Ng was appointed to serve as an Executive Director and VP of Operations and Business Development of the Company. Ms. Ng is a lawyer qualified in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region since 2011, specializing in international cross border mergers and acquisitions transactions and corporate commercial matters. Ms. Ng is currently an independent non-executive director of China Internet Investment Finance Holdings Limited (stock code: 810) since 2013, a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

 China Internet Investment Finance Holding is a website-less penny stock listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. It describes itself as a public investment manager with a market cap of hk 185M. The stock is currently trading around hk1.5 with its last recorded peak price at hk3.8 in 2018.

&#x200B;

**Ms Qin “ Carol” Wang: CFO,Treasurer,and secretary.**

Ms. Wang has been an independent financial consultant since June 202, specializing in M&A transaction for companies listed on the Nasdag and on the NYSE stock exchange. Prior to that, she served as the finance controller and financial advisor of TD Holdings, inc ( Nasdag: GLG) from february 2018 to May 2020. Through July 2016 and January 2018, she was a senior Investment manager for Yikuan Asset Management Company.

TD HOLDINGS is a penny stock valued at $54M with a stock priced at $0.39. The company is engaged in the commodity trading and supply chain services in China. My research into Yikuan Asset Management were rather fruitless. 

&#x200B;

My investigations into Tibbers Wong ( CEO of Meta, the Gamefi’s subsidiary) and well as Mr Raison Xiong ( CTO) were rather fruitless. According to their biographical presentations, both Mr Tibber Wong and Mr Raison Xiong “ have worked” as Gaming producer and director for Tencent Gaming studio in China. They have, allegedly, been involved in hundreds of successful gaming productions with an user base of up to 300M player with revenue over $2 Billions.No specific games titles were presented or described. Simple generalities meant to be accepted as facts. 

&#x200B;

The analysis of AeroCentury Corp leadership draws a rather clear picture with regards to its stated claims of future success in the “GameFi/Metaverse”: **It is all hogwash!** 

There is nothing remotely believable about Mr Hu Yucheng’s prognostication about his company. 

Typical of most China’s Hustle type ventures, Aerocentury is a concoction meant on exploiting the growing ‘ Gamefi” market and excite naive Investors into buying unto its story. The $11M investment into a bankrupted Aircraft leasing company was simply meant on setting foot into the liquidity rich and speculatively euphoric NYSE.

 Speculation is rampant across the entire financial economy with small investors seeking to ride the last tide of an apparent un-ending bull market. Mr Hu Yucheng and his cohorts are fully aware of the rich possibilities that a properly constructed “ lie” can yield in terms of return on invested capital in the short run. 

Building upon the growing metaverse and Gamefi “ play to earn” opportunity thus seem to be a perfect recipe for a quick multiple bagger profit on greedy and foolish “ Western” speculators.

Let's break down some of the holdings

[**TSLA**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA) **:** 8.55%

This one is controversial. Personally I believe that tesla is a hit or miss honestly. It's overvalued and if it fails to deliver (even for a single quarter) the stock's price is going to plummet. It's a high risk low reward pick at the moment. It was a good investment in 2014 - 2019 ,but not anymore.

Investors have a tendency to buy the highs and sell the lows. All the people that are buying Tesla right now have already missed the chance of making big money on the stock. Do you honestly believe that Tesla is going to 10x your money? You've already missed your chance ,even if Tesla does great and beats the competition ,it's not going to 10x your money. I'd be surprised if it even tripled your money.

[**ZM**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM?p=ZM) **:** 6.17%

Zoom is a garbage application ,that lags ,lacks features and it cannot compete with other alternatives like Microsoft Teams. The only reason Zoom performed good ,was because of the pandemic and because they had a competitive advantage. For example schools across Europe forced students and teachers to use it during quarantine. Now that the pandemic is over they've lost their competitive advantage and companies will start adopting better alternatives like Microsoft Teams .

[**COIN**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN?p=COIN) **:** 5.19%

Has lot of potential if crypto becomes widely adopted. Coinbase is by far the easiest platform to navigate through. If the average Joe wants to buy crypto ,he will probably buy it on Coinbase. This is by far the best investment in the whole portfolio. It's a high risk ,high reward bet.

[**U**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/U?p=U) **:** 4.33%

Unity used to be the best engine for video game design ,but not anymore. They now have a lot of competition and their competitors are at the same level or better in some areas. For example Godot (a free software) is as good as unity for 2D video games. Heck I'd say it's even better than Unity for 2D game design. Also Unreal Engine has better graphics than unity and comes with a lot of extra features that Unity doesn't have out of the box . The only competitive advantage Unity has ,is that there are thousands of tutorials ,assets ,documents etc. for Unity compared to it's competitors. But that doesn't matter to professional video game designers ,they already have experience making video games and can pick any Engine they like.

[**SPOT**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT?p=SPOT) **:** 4.44%

Spotify was a revolutionary application ,but it now faces a lot of competition. Big tech companies like Google and Apple have come up with their own version of Spotify .Why would anyone pay for Spotify when they are already part of an eco system. If you are an Apple groupie and you own the iphone ,the imac ,apple tv and so on ,chances are you are also going to own Apple music. All the big tech companies have a competitive advantage against spotify ,they have made an eco system of products and they can force you to use their product instead of spotify's.

This means that spotify will slowly be losing more market share to competitors until it's market share reaches a specific point. Ofcourse the company is not going to go bankrupt ,but it's not a growth stock as some might think.

From the top holdings TSLA and COIN are the only companies that make any sense and I haven't even mentioned Roku and TDOC.

If one or two of these investments goes tits down your portfolio will be crushed.

Now let's check the math. Below is a chart that compares ARKK ,S&P 500 and SOXX

[https://imgur.com/a/4LA3xN5](https://imgur.com/a/4LA3xN5)

Yeah it's true that ARKK outperformed the S&P500 in the last 5 years ,but as you can notice ARKK has been on a down trend ever since. You must realize that sudden 600% increases are not sustainable in the long run. The only reason ARKK did so good in the first place is because of TSLA and because of the pandemic.

I've also included SOXX in the graph to show people that you don't have to buy crap to outperform the S&P 500. SOXX has managed to outperform ARKK in the long run ,without taking too much risk. With the Internet Of Things ,everything is going to require a chip in the next few years. I think TSLA fanboys are the ones who understand this the most.

My point is that high risk must come with high reward. If I can achieve the same performance by buying SOXX for a fraction of the risk ,why should I buy ARKK? An ETF that consists mostly of crappy companies ,companies that are constantly losing market share and speculative companies?

I don't hate people who buy ARKK ,I don't like the fact that everyone is promoting ARKK as a good investment that can 10x your money and a lot of naive investors will end up losing their money listening to those fake gurus."

The U.S. economy added far fewer jobs than expected in December just as the nation was grappling with a massive surge in Covid cases, the Labor Department said Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls grew by 199,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That compared to the Dow Jones estimate of 422,000 for the payrolls number and 4.1% for the unemployment rate.

Job creation was highest in leisure and hospitality, a key recovery sector, which added 53,000. Professional and business services contributed 43,000 while manufacturing added 43,000.

The numbers come at a crossroads for the U.S. economy as more than half a million Covid cases per day, many related to the omicron variant, threaten to stall an economic recovery that looks to accelerate in 2022.

While growth decelerated through the summer, economists expect that GDP rose sharply at the end of the year, with the Atlanta Fed tracking 6.7% growth. Federal Reserve officials have been watching the data closely.

Inflation is running at its strongest pace in nearly 40 years, while some policymakers see the jobs market near full employment. Consequently, the central bank has indicated it will begin slowing the help it has been providing the economy since the pandemic began.

Friday’s report covered the week including Dec. 12, which came before the worst of an omicron spike that began heading into Christmas."

The European chip maker STM, +1.57% STM, 5.48% said preliminary figures showed revenue jumped to $3.56 billion from $3.24 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020.

The company had targeted revenue of $3.40 billion, plus or minus 350 basis points. The result means revenue is now 140 basis points above the high end of the guided range. 

“We ended 4Q21 with net revenues above the outlook range and gross margin at or slightly above the high-end of the outlook range, primarily due to better than anticipated operations in an ongoing dynamic market,” Chief Executive Jean-Marc Chery said. 

STMicroelectronics will release fourth-quarter and 2021 results on Jan. 27.

I am still pretty overweight when it comes to index and positions in the NASDAQ so if we have another drop like last Feb/March of last year I'd like to purchase some OTM puts.  

I'm looking for an unprofitable company that people really don't see a lot of future growth, but still have room to fall.  This way if the whole sector goes, they are the first to fall and the hardest to fall.   I sell a lot of premium on TSLA, NFLX, and NVDA also so this last week hasn't been great but I still feel good about my positions.  Just need to start hedging my delta since a lot of my long term holdings are in the sector.  I think my diversification and uncorrelated positions look good, so not looking to simply ""buy more in the value or energy sectors"".

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Basically, I’m wondering if I should cash out, so that I have some liquid cash as a nest egg for rent, expenses, emergencies, etc after I graduate. (Currently blessed that my parents pay my expenses, but that ends at graduation)

Some factors:
- currently I have a 70% / 30% stock to cash ratio, roughly
- I live in Austin (it’s expensive)
- I am pretty confident that I have a job secured once I graduate, but it’s not 100% sure. It will pay $50-60k probably.

Obviously it’s hard for u to answer this bc everyone has different financial goals, but what are some other factors u would consider in my situation?

TLDR: basically, if the market crashes in the next few months, I don’t want to lose my gains as I enter the job market as a 22 year old. Am I over thinking it?"

71,2022-01-07 01:25:07,"Number of Nasdaq Stocks Down 50% or More Is Almost at a Record(Bloomberg) -- A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.

Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values halve from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at S--dial Capital Research. 

“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.

Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-come bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak. 

“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”

Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting -- released on Wednesday -- pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.

All this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs. 

The Nasdaq Composite index is on pace for its biggest weekly decline since November, even as it rose in the New York afternoon trading session Thursday. A 3.3% fall Wednesday marked its worst single-day session since February last year.

77,2022-01-06 22:29:17,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Jan 6, 2022. Please enjoy! 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 6, 2022**

After the worst day for technology stocks since March, the market finished modestly lower in a very volatile session, with stocks dropping hard in the morning before recovering throughout the session as market participants continue to digest signals from the Fed that an interest rate hike may come “relatively soon”. 

Despite the imminent interest rate hike and elevated inflation, it seems market participants are eagerly buying up the dip, with volume in both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) surging (86 million shares traded vs 65 million average in SPY & 70 million shares traded vs 41 million average in the Nasdaq).

Looking ahead, the Department of Labor’s December job report is due for release Friday., which will shed more light on the state of the labor market. 

**Notable Numbers** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.09%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.07%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.47%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.57%
* Volatility Index: -0.61%
* Facebook (FB): +2.99%
* Alibaba (BABA): +4.65%
* Ford Motors (F): +3.38%
* Humana (HUM): -19.56%
* Allbird (BIRDS): +11.86%
* Gamestop (GME): +30% after-hours
* Beyond Meat (BYND): +14.65%

The Labor Department’s December monthly job report will offer a meaningful look into the strength of hiring and labor force participation - two key measures to gauge the health of the labor market, especially amid rising prices and surging Omicron cases. Economists are expecting the economy to add 444,000 new jobs.

Additionally, market participants weighed on today’s weekly unemployment report, which showed the first-time unemployment claims ticked up compared to the previous week but remain near 52-week lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market. Here are the numbers: 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended Jan. 1:** 207,000 vs. 195,000 expected and a revised 200,000 during the prior week
* **Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 25:** 1.754 million vs. 1.678 million expected and a revised 1.718 million during the prior week.

On Wednesday, the markets sold off after the Fed’s meeting minutes suggested the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation. 

The meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate."" 

Moreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

86,2022-01-06 20:13:05,"Tech startup IPO and fully vested shares - adviceHello, not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice on a subject like this but figured I'll give it a shot. Apologies for the long-windedness but I just want to make sure I provide as much detail as possible.

I worked for a venture-backed tech startup between the years of 2011 and 2016. I was awarded 30,000 shares of company stock and was fully vested when I left in 2016. I exercised my shares and paid for them out of pocket, and I was given a stock certificate and documentation proving that I fully own the equity.

Fast forward to early November 2021 - I received an email from the company alerting me to an impending IPO. I was told I would receive documentation (called transmittal letter) to fill out and sign in order to gain access to my shares. I was advised there is no lockout period.

I received the documentation on Nov 30, and the company went public literally a day later on Dec 1. There were errors on the document that needed fixing (my name was spelled wrong, my address was not current, etc). I emailed the address they provided (third party stock transfer and trust company) to make the changes and after a few days did not receive a response. I followed up a week later and received nothing back. Finally I phoned them directly and they confirmed that I can provide them with the signed document with the errors corrected myself (strikethrough and initial) and it should be fine. I did this and sent it in. By now the stock, which debuted at $10 per share, is down to $6-7 per share.

At this point it's more than half way through December. I was expecting an invoice with information on how to transfer the stock to my brokerage account. I'm waiting and waiting and receive nothing. Xmas week makes it impossible to get through to anyone. Finally after xmas I phone the stock transfer and trust company, and they claim they have sent me an invoice with the information needed to receive the stock into my brokerage account. After checking my spam and trash folders I can confirm that I received nothing. The person on the phone manually sends me another one, and this time I receive it. It's now Dec 28, and the stock is still hovering around $6-7 per share. I contact my bank and use the invoice to initiate the transfer of the shares into my brokerage account.

Fast forward to yesterday - the transfer request has been rejected by the stock transfer and trust company due to technical reasons and I've spent the last few days on the phone with both sides trying to get it sorted out. I'm hoping to have access to the stock by early next week. It's now down to under $6 per share.

I've told this long-ass story to give some context so that I might ask for advice of this community. It seems to me that since I purchased the vested stock in 2016, and have owned it ever since, I should have had the right and ability to sell it as soon as it hit the market at $10 per share. The fact that I've been fighting for over a month now to gain access to shares that I supposedly already own is very troubling, and the drop from $10 to less than $6 per share since the debut represents tens of thousands of dollars of lost value to me. I was planning to sell a large portion of the stock at $10 as soon as it hit the market - and now I can't. Obviously it could go back up again, but my issue is that I couldn't sell it then even though I wanted to.

Is this normal for a situation like this? Does it usually take so much time to get access to shares that you already own? Should I have been given the ability to fill out the paperwork and have access to my shares in advance of the IPO? Does it sound like I have any kind of legal recourse in this matter? Any input or advice is appreciated. Thank you."

BA, ALLK, PINS.


BA; hasn't fully recovered since covid, and it only makes sense that it should go up significantly till ~2030. Why wouldn't it? Travel by air is expected to increase significantly by then. Boeing is very well-established and is at no risk of losing the top 2 spot of market share. Great buy and hold till 2030 or beyond.

ALLK; Strong drop in its price a few weeks ago without any fundamental change in its business model is ALLK. Too many panic sellers I presume. The drop is caused by an embarrassing failure in a study, but it should revive. It’s trading at single digits. Since its inception its price has never been lower than $30, and consistently around $80-$120 for the last year or two. Its industry is biotechnology, no worries there.

PINS; I also like PINS, but would wait until its share price stabilizes somewhat, I'd give it a few months. They started generating revenue lately, and have plans to expand to retail and whatnot. Business model is pretty unique. And they’re the best at their niche field bar none. Financial statement while I haven’t analyzed it properly does not exactly scream “wow :O”, but that is expected for its specific context/circumstances.

What do you think?

Others I have in mind would be ORGN, ME, CHGG, AIRS, BYND, ABNB, MTTR. Or for less risky stocks: PYPL, and least riskiest: INTC (and BA). But at my age, I’m all in for those risks, only ~25% of my portfolio will comprise less risky stocks as INTC and VOO."

But I find it noticeable how people are shamed everywhere on the internet for having a portfolio mainly in growth. They are being told they need to actually learn how to invest now that the growth sector is having a dip; ditching their ""reckless"" picks for more ""respectable"" value stocks. It's like people are hated for trying to go for the 60-100% return instead of the more traditional 8% return value stocks will give you.

105,2022-01-06 16:01:12,"An S&P 500 Bear -- Full teardown# The last few weeks in the S&P500 have been a bit of a roller-coaster ride declining just over 5% in a 8 day period and subsequently making several new all times highs over the following 15 day period.

Your analysis suggests you should want to be bearish the S&P500. You are pretty (\*\*extremely\*\*) sure it’s going down.  Here is some information you might want to know before you take that bet.

In each 10-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher one day ten is 62%.

**But… the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 88.82%. Let’s dig deeper.**

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO](https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO) (Source: [Tradewell](https://tradewell.app))

The chart above shows every single 10-day return period for the S&P500 ETF, the $SPY, since its inception.

The blue lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY closed higher at least once.

The red lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY did \*not\* close higher at least once, ie. T\[0\] was the highest price the $SPY traded over the next 10 days.

If it’s not already obvious there are **a lot** bluer lines than there are red lines.  In each of the charts shown below the red lines will depict price paths that did not close higher at least once.

# The same applies on a 15 and 20 day-timeframes:

* \-  In each 15-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 15 is 64% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 91.53%.
* \-  In each 20-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 20 is 65% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 93%.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT](https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT) (Source: Tradewell)

And how about in a 60-day period. Historically, 97% of the time the SPY has closed higher at least once over the next 60 trading days.  \*\*Incredible\*\*.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY](https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY) (Source: Tradewell)

# So, what are the obvious and not-so obvious takeaways from this:

1. The S&P500 has a natural upside drift on virtually every time frame the SPY has well over a 50% chance of closing higher than where it started.
2. The price path the SPY takes to its destination has a lot of new highs from the starting point.  In each of the 10, 15, 20 and 60 day timeframes the $SPY has historically had a probability of closing higher at least once 89%, 92%, 93%, and 97% of the time respectively.

106,2022-01-06 16:00:30,"As a ""plant based"" investor, Tattooed Chef (TTCF) is garbageI am the target demographic for Tattooed Chef. The stock is majorly down right now so I'm not just trying to pile on, but feel like this perspective might be useful.

I've been investing in plant based companies since 2015. I made a great return on WWAV before it was bought out by Danone and lost an equal amount on SZYM/TVIA before they went bankrupt. I've watched BYND with interest but thought they were extremely overhyped. I consider myself to be an activist investor and will gladly support anything that makes vegan food more accessible. Tattooed Chef (TTCF) is a company that really interested me and I started a small position last year (since exited at a loss).

To me this company could have been the holy grail of the ""plant based investing trend"" - vertical integration, food that actually tastes great, using real and diverse kinds of foods rather than just relying on a fake meat, etc. I even buy the growth thesis and would have been willing to baghold for a decade if that's what it took. But there's just one problem:

As someone who has been vegan for 15 years, fuck this company.

The term ""plant based"" is stupid as hell and came out of rich people turning veganism into an elitist health fad, but OK - I'm willing to just humor it in the name of there being more products available and fewer animals in our food chain.

But you don't get to call yourself a ""plant based"" company, use it in all your marketing, base the entire identity of your brand around it, and then go on ahead with actively developing and distributing shit that has cheese in it.

I'm sure you're reading this thinking ""screw this whiny vegan, plant based doesn't have to mean vegan, bla bla bla"" and that's great that you have that opinion but here's my whole point:

No one with any integrity is going to support this company. If you are NOT vegan and just cynically investing in plant based companies to try and catch the trend, then you at least owe it to yourself to accept some DD from the people who are supposedly going to bankroll this dietary shift, become fans of the company on social media, introduce it to their friends and family, etc.

TTCF has actively flushed any goodwill they may have had with the vegan community. First there was the packaging debacle where vegetarian items were incorrectly labeled as vegan (a cardinal sin and just *so* stupid) and now the continued investment in animal products while blowing the ""plant based"" horn.

There is a fundamental disconnect between what this company thinks it is and what it actually is. And consumers - especially vegan consumers like myself who have *actively trained themselves* to care about what they're buying - are not fooled. Tattooed Chef is an absolute laughing stock.

There are other reasons to think this company is suspect (reliance on single use plastics, the goofy-ass branding, the lameness of the namesake, uhh the financials) but if you are taking the Peter Lynch approach to investing and looking for companies that customers can fall in love with, take it from me this is not it.

TL;DR - The title."

Hi all I’m relatively new to investing and would like your tips!

I have been a fan of index funds namely sp500s and MSCI world. I have never actually invested (I should!) however it seems rising interest rates would make it a bad time to do so or is it?

I hear the saying time in the market is always best so would I simply benefit in dropping 100K on large equity indexes (I have an emergency fund on top).

Or would I benefit into diverging into multi asset funds with FI, and alternatives to hedge inflation?

I’m worried tho in dropping 100K in equity funds as the world of 2030-2040 does sound a bit scary with looming environment and social crisis (or am I overreacting)? 

Finally how much importance do you place on ESG low carbon funds ?

Thanks!"

I am for Bulgaria and using Interactive Brokers from trading. Due to the fact that I am outside of the US, I am not able to buy any of the VTI or VOO, or SPY. 

I was looking at some iShare ETFs that are based in the EU that I could buy but they are so many that it is hard to choose. 

I am not even sure I know what is the difference between them. All I need is an ETF that tracks SP500 that I can dump my money in. I have individual stocks like TSLA, APPL, MSFT, NVDA, LMND but most are Nasdaq related and my risk tolerance is getting lower and lower.

# [Dow futures nudge higher after Wednesday’s Fed-induced sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures edged higher in early trading Thursday, recovering after worries over tighter monetary policy led to the first losing regular trading session of the year.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 104 points, or 0.29%. S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.37%.
*****
> Energy shares helped boost the market in early action as crude prices rose 1.5%. Marathon Oil gained 2.6%, Occidental Petroleum was up 2.2% and ExxonMobil rose 1.3%.
*****
> Rate-sensitive stocks also were higher a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting revealed the central bank is getting ready to remove its economic help more more quickly than anticipated. Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.
*****
> Elsewhere Thursday, shares of Allbirds rallied more than 4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shoe brand, whose stock has struggled since it went public in November.
*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1. Trade balance data is also due, with economists looking for the deficit in goods and services to total $81.5 billion.
*****
> The releases come a day ahead of the Labor Department’s key nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the economy added 422,000 jobs in December. However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Who then buys then pays the $1,200 since you would only be paying for the $500 put option?

129,2022-01-06 05:12:28,"Question about companies using interestHey yall,

Not sure this has been asked before but please bare with me here.

I was curious about something.

So when we look at the stockmarket, its very rare to find a company that doesn't use interest/loans to fund their operations OR to find a company that doesn't deposit its savings into banks and gain interest on it.

However, when I do a DD on a company lets say Apple for example, we see that the main business is tablets, computers, phones etc... But no where in its main business model does it say ""Apple puts this much into banks and collects interest"" or ""Apple used this loan with this interest rate to pay for its operations."" So its obvious that stuff like financials is not part of its main business model nor should it effect how investors value the company.

However out of curiosity, when any company decides to use loans to fund operations OR decides to deposit its savings into banks, who actually decides on that? Because in the main business operations no where does it tell us that these companies deal with banks? So is it safe to assume that the administration does it? So in this case can we say that fundamentally what these companies do and how they operate is separate from what the administration does in regards to getting loans and stuff? 

# I know this was probably confusing so maybere heres an easier summary:

If I invest in a banking company, I know its fundamental operations is using loans and profiting off of interest and what not. 

However, when I invest in a company like Apple or Microsoft, its fundamental operations have nothing to do with loans and interest, but for sure they are still using loans and interest, so does the administration decides that?"
130,2022-01-06 05:11:31,"Overview of Himax Technologies ($HIMX)Company: Himax Technologies 

Ticker: HIMX 

Country: Taiwan

Industry: Electronic Equipment

Market Cap: $1.98 Billion

[Investors Presentation](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)

[Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=himx)

Himax Technologies is a small cap tech firm based out of Taiwan.  They manufacture electronics used in TVs, Cars, and Augmented / Virtual Reality. 

---

•    Gross Margin – 44% 

•    Operating Margin – 30%

•    Net Margin – 24% 

•    Return on Equity – 55%

•    Return on Assets – 30%

---

The company pays a considerably low tax rate while sustaining high revenue growth, and has found a soluble business model that allows them to operate at a relatively higher margin than its industry peers. Their return on equity is considerably high as well, indicating a proactive managerial strategy. 

There are however risks to this company. They operate in Taiwan which is currently on the brink of war with China, and shifts in the geopolitical regime can threaten their mere existence at any time. 
There is a significant short interest at play as well, with 15% of the float being borrowed against the company. Due to this, Himax is trading at a significant discount that some might call a value trap, with a P/E of 6.3x and a P/S of 1.4x. The market is not placing many bets in favor of this company. 

Despite this they continue to steadily grow at a 3-year annualized rate of 26%, with 2019 revenues of $671 Million increasing to $1.37 Billion as of 2021. Operating income went from ($18 Million) to $410 Million in the same span of time. This is due to stable SG&A and R&D. 

---

**Pros:**

•    Aggressive top-line growth with little debt holding them back 

•    Up and coming player in a key industry for next-gen consumer electronics 

•    Still small-cap and in the midst of a growth phase

•    Very bullish and shareholder-friendly management, aggressive capital commitment from board and CEO

**Risks & Problems:**

•    Geopolitical Risk of China

•    High Short Interest & Volatility

•    Not Increasing SG&A or R&D with Revenue

•    2% Dividend (Could be reinvested towards expanding R&D)

---

Overall, Himax could make for a great value play to add to a tech portfolio. They are somewhat conservative with their approach but have done well in stabilizing growth and staying afloat in a high-risk high-reward industry. If it finds support at $10, a viable entry for a long term position could be initiated."

I'm talking to those of you, like myself, that try to keep a small amount of cash (e.g., 5%-20%) for buying moments.  Right now, I'm thinking about SHOP, QQQ, and GOOG.  

However, I think there is still room for a decline (especially for SHOP).  So, I'd recommend two things for all of you to keep in mind (which may help you resist FOMO).

1. It can always go cheaper.  
2. There are always good buying opportunities.  If you ""miss out"" on SHOP and volatility sends it back up; there is always another apple in the orchard.  I know someone that dumped all of their meme stock money into SHOP when it dipped down to $1000/share mid-2020 and--while they're still in the green--I think they could have put that money to better use.

137,2022-01-06 03:10:28,"What happens when those invested in mega-caps decide to cash out and take profits?The sell off in ""growth"" and small and mid-caps has so far excluded the big, sturdy companies, and traditionally solid, some of which are referred to by those on reddit as ""boomer"" stocks. Now it seems this sentiment of selling shares is just beggining to bleed into the share value of such companies.

So what happens if they end up becoming sold off? Meanwhile will the sell off of smaller and ""growth"" caps cease? Will the money exiting get applied to those sectors previously sold off and a sort of rotation will occur?

I'm almost envisioning a correction and maybe recession territory which will have been proceeded by a brief crash which is all yet to come. But I think this occurrence will be unique to any prior. I believe it'll occur in separate sectors and won't take down the market all at once. It'll rotate in and out of different sectors segregated. Those sectors currently unaffected will remain flat or even slightly up until the correction sentiment rotates and hits them once again.

I believe we'll have a slight market-wide crash and then the continued strange partitioned incremental rotational correction previously described. I fear we'll begin to see this once the profit taking and cashing out of mega-caps begins once the fear of the other stocks falling becomes unbearable and that profit looks more and more tempting to cash out *now*. And once mega-caps begin plummeting the market-wide crash follows. And after that begins the rotational correction. Economy hits a recession. Then enough sentiment of a bottom occurs for investment money to start pouring in. Momentum investors follow suit and eventually even those most cautious and conservative, tho shamefully late, let themselves back to the party. And such will be the recovery.

Start of recovery and markets more-or-less getting back to even with the height of 2020 (this recession won't have the use of fed dollars unfortunately after being found by citizens ineffectively used for the pandemic after the crash finally occurs, also slight population contraction further exasperating labor stresses will also contribute to hamstring any active government response by lower tax dollar revenue as societal obligations increase with boomer health failing along with neglected infrastructure and thus our tax expenditures increase with even less tax revenue)...I'd say a good 7 years and everything you hold right now that has no chance of going bankrupt—I'd guarantee will be at a profit.

The only thing that can't be guaranteed is we'll all be alive to see this."
138,2022-01-06 02:54:34,"Cathie Wood’s ARK ETFs Are in a Deep Hole—Alreadyhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/ark-etf-funds-performance-51641424042

The new year didn’t bring a fresh start for Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, a fund company known for its focus on innovation stocks and high price targets.

The firm’s flagship ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ticker: ARKK) plunged 7.1% in Wednesday trading, marking its worst day since Sept 3, 2020. All of ARK’s other ETFs, including the latest, ARK Transparency (CTRU)—launched in December—are also deep in negative territory.  

Growth stocks fell on Wednesday after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting were released, suggesting that the central bank’s rate increases might be earlier and faster than market has expected. 

Investors were spooked as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shifted his tone to emphasize the risks of inflation—after months of describing rising prices as “transitory”—as a new Covid-19 variant is rampaging across the country and causing supply-chain disruptions.

The S&P 500 lost 2% in the last two hours of Wednesday’s trading, growth stocks within the index tumbled 3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3%. 

But the ARK ETFs were some of the worst-performing funds amid Wednesday’s decline. Besides ARK Innovation, ARK Genomic Revolution (ARKG) was down 7.1%, ARK Fintech Innovation (ARKF) dropped 6.6%, and ARK Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fell 6.2%. Other groups of growth stocks, such as blockchain, cannabis, clean energy, and technology, were also deep in the red. 

Wednesday’s loss was just the latest stretch of ARK funds’ year-long struggle. ARK ETFs were some of the best-performing funds in 2020, soaring an average of 150% as the pandemic accelerated the adoption of many emerging platforms and technologies that companies in its portfolios own.

Since peaking in February 2021, however, the funds have been tumbling downhill, shedding much of their gains from the year before. Rising inflation has made the future cash flow of growth-oriented innovation firms less valuable today, and investors were seeking returns from safer corners, such as cheaply traded cyclical stocks.

With the Fed’s hawkish pivot, it looks like the volatility in growth stocks and ARK funds will continue. But if inflation can be somewhat contained following the Fed’s tightening policy in 2022, innovation stocks might embrace some rebound—though that won’t be anytime soon."

This shift means something to me. I think that from now on, companies that resonates more with the milenial state of mind (like EV companies, weed, solar or clean energy companies, e-commerce and even ""kripto"" (missplening so I can post it here)) will actually boom more than ever.

Hi,

My girlfriend (soon to be wife hopefully) had to roll over a few investment accounts in the last few months and now finds she a lot of cash on the sidelines. She has invested some of it, but is asking me for advice on where to put the rest.

She makes around $120K/year.

She has around $2600 in a Roth IRA where she has:

$1000 in cash

2 shares of COIN

1 share NVDA

1 share TGT

4 shares RRR

2 share DIS

5 shares ASO

1 share META

1 share COF

2 shares WYNN

She has around $27K in a former employer 401K which she is going to leave.

She has around $8500 in the current employer 401K – which she is leaving obviously.

She has another $40K in checks and savings.

The question is what do to with the $69K she has in the rollover IRA. $56K is in cash in addition to the following investments in that account:

$1400 in FBGRX

$1490 in FZILX

$1000 in FITLX

$1500 in FZROX

$1100 in FMEIX

$1000 in FPURX

$1500 in FXAIX

$520 in FVAL

$2500 in FARMX

Given the small balance in the Roth and what she bought so far I am thinking that can be an account for speculative plays.

The advice she is seeking is where and how to invest the remaining money in the rollover IRA.

She has basically asked me to just do whatever I think it right with it but I don’t feel comfortable doing that.

In addition to doing research the last few months on my own, I figured I would post here to see if there was any insight I could take back to her and we could research together.

My idea was to invest in mainly Fidelity mutual funds with lower expense ratios (some of the zero funds) or Fidelity index funds. Maybe some ETFs?

I know there is a little bit of overlap in the investments in some of the ones she is already in.

I am hoping to have her invest in a few more to cover the whole spectrum. I am getting too caught up in the range of ‘mid-cap value’ and ‘large cap growth’ funds thinking she should get the best in each category.

This money is going to stay invested for the next 20-30 years.

Thanks for any input."

147,2022-01-05 23:40:49,"Why would you buy the s&p 500 when you can buy a quality ETFSo before I start this iam a big fan of quality investing. You may think buffet is a value investor but he is not, he is a quality investor. At the start of his career he was a value investor where he would buy the so called 'cigar butt' companies. When he met Charlie munger he became a quality investor. One reason to support this statement is the quote the goes something like ""it's better to buy a great company at a good price compared to a good company at a great price""

Quality investing is where you want to buy a company with high ROC. Below is one qoute from Charlie munger on why ROC is important.


""Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better
return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business
earns six percent on capital over forty years and you hold it for that
forty years, you're not going to make much different than a six percent
return - even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely,
if a business earns eighteen percent on capital over twenty or thirty
years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end
up with one hell of a result.""


Normally a company with high ROC would attract competition so when buying a quality company buy a company with a ""moat"".

Normally good companies (companies with high ROC) will never become bad companies. I can't upload pictures here but if you want me to send you the data to support this statement private message me or message me on Instagram royalshah10 (where I post alot of investing information)

I also have data for historical ROC for certain sectors and when analysing this data it tells me that certain sectors like utilities have low ROC historical so it's best to avoid that sector, and some sectors like pharmaceuticals have high ROC so it's a good idea to buy those sectors.

Now let's get in to quality ETFs. (I live in Europe so these are European etfs I will be mentioning. You can probably find a US equivalent ETF)

If l look at IUQA a USA quality index it has outperformed the s&p 500 with a return of 121% compared to a 106% return. IWQU and IEQU, a world index and a European index have also outperformed their normal respective index.

If I look at the USA index it is also cheaper looking at the PE ratio compared to the S&P 500. This is amazing because you are buying significantly better companies at a cheaper price.


Now after reading this why would you buy crap companies when you buy the S&P 500 when you can take all the bad companies out and only own the good companies when you buy a quality index.


Their may be short cyclical periods where the crap companies will outperform the quality companies but over the long term quality will always win. Quality will also protect you better when markets are in a down turn.


If you guys want to learn about quality investing I recommend watching Terry Smith, Terry Smith does a yearly AGM for his global fund every year and they are a great watch.

Tell me what you guys think about quality investing and will you buy a quality ETF over a S&P 500? (Historically quality outperformes)

If you Americans can own the fundsmith equity fund it's an amazing fund ran by Terry Smith. If you can't then you can also buy Smithson investment trust from fundsmith. This is a Small cap focused fund and it trades on the LSE the ticker is SSON. It also follows the quality style. There's also a emerging markets trust that follows the quality style, the ticker is FEET, it hasn't performed well but emerging markets as a whole hasn't done well but the future could be different."

*Sorry, there was no recap yesterday, I spent all day traveling back home after spending holidays/ New Year back with friends and family. Unfortunate how the market performed while I was gone*

The stock market sank on Wednesday, pressured by a sell-off in technology stocks, as market participants digest the Fed’s latest meeting, which suggests an interest raise hike could happen ‘relatively soon’. As a result, growth stocks and technology stocks harshly pulled back. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a fresh intraday record high in the morning before slipping in the afternoon to close lower.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.92%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -3.07%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.03%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -3.39%
* Tesla (TSLA): -5.35%
* Roku (ROKU): -11.72%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.96%
* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.89%
* Alphabet (GOOG: -4.51%
* Rivian (RIVN): -11.22%
* Block (SQ): -8.21%

The meeting minutes from the Fed’s December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.

The meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.""

Moreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

Treasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.

Scott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, “Yields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end — the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve — that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.""

This morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.

Hiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.

While service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.

Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said “December’s job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron’s impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.”

[https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx)

Following the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.

As I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, it’s time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.

**Highlights**

* The Omicron variant continues to surge across the US, with the country once again recording a new record high. On January 4, the US reported 885,451 new coronavirus infections, more than tripling the peak of any of the previous surges.
* Ford Motors (F) stock recently jumped more than 10% after the company announced it planned to double production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.
* Ford also reported sales for 2021 fell 6.8% compared to 2020 but had a very strong fourth-quarter, a sign that demand could begin to pick up. Ford sold 508,451 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 27% increase over the previous quarter
* Meta Platforms (FB) has ceased development of a new VR/AR software operating system that employed more than 300 after four years. Meta quickly issued a statement via Gabriel Aul, its vice president of Reality Labs Engineering. ""There are several technical directions we're pursuing in our efforts to build the operating systems, we're still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices - we remain very much invested in this work and continue to dedicate the resources necessary to build this.”
* GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023.
* WarnerMedia’s HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services. HBO ended the year with 73.8 million subscribers to its streaming service and namesake cable network, up from 69.4 million in September.

156,2022-01-05 22:24:00,"Implied Volatility and LEAPSI recently completed a few trades where I looked for in the money call options that are  9 months to 1 year out and whose implied volatility at the time of purchase was lower than the historical average for that stock.  These trades worked out so I am interested in pursuing more trades like this on a more regular basis.  I stick to large companies - KO being the most recent trade - under the assumption that they are less likely to experience rapid shifts in implied volatility.  

I'm fully aware that my small sample is not representative and the trades can go badly if the implied volatility doesn't move back towards the mean, Can someone who has used or is using this strategy comment on what other variables might be worth considering in addition to the implied volatility metric I used to maybe improve the chances for a successful LEAP trade?"
157,2022-01-05 22:01:59,"The perfect time for long term investors to buy their favourite growth stocks?  
Since Feb 2021, at that first sniff of inflation and the prospect of interest rate rises, growth stocks have seen a continual and quite brutal decline with many well over 50% down from their ATH's and some even as far as 80%.   


If you go back in time to a year ago today, these boards were full of bull cases for these rapidly accelerating stocks. Companies with revenue growth of 40%+ YoY, terrific balance sheets, good business models in growing markets still in the infancy of their business life cycles . All the type of things a person wishing to buy stocks and hold for the long term absolutely love to see. Fast forward to today and you can hardly give these types of stock away. Sentiment could not be lower. Which is exactly the reason I have decided to take the funds out of my ISA (which was essentially losing me money anyway) and put the whole thing into growth stocks that I really love.   


Stocks like Pinterest for instance; its trading at a valuation that it was in 2019, at a time when its revenues are half of what it is now, its began to prove it can turn a profit, massive companies like Microsoft and PAYPAL are sniffing around wanting to buy it. Yet here it is, 60% down from its highs, trading at 2019 levels, and its making more money than ever, with no sign of that slowing down as it continues to generate more revenue per customer every quarter.   


The market it currently full of stocks like this. The likes of Square, Palantir, Crowdstrike, Draftkings, cloudfare, SoFi; all the stocks that got people so excited 12 months ago. They are all making more money now (quite a lot more) than they were this time last year but are trading at half the valuations. This is exactly the scenario people should want. All those reasons for optimism last year are still valid, arguably more so.   


For me, ive decided to sell some of my safer investments and open big positions in some of these stocks now with the intention of holding them for a long time. If they market continues to drop, thats fine, I will buy more. Because at these valuations, I feel a heck of a lot more comfortable."
158,2022-01-05 22:01:15,"FOMC is serious about raising rates. Market is slow to price it in, hence big drop today. If rates hit 2%, what would SPY and QQQ be at?There is a relationship between stock price and interest rates, if interest rates suddenly go up, stock prices (all things being equal) should go down. 

Today the FOMC showed they're serious about raising rates and SPY and QQQ and all other stocks repriced.

The market seems to be pricing it in, bit by bit.


Assuming everything else stays the same, what should SPY and QQQ be when interest rates are 2%?

Bonus question - how do we calculate it for other stocks?"

168,2022-01-05 19:47:32,"GM And EVs. A discussionI have been reading a variety of bearish posts which seem to ignore everything that i have been reading around GM and the EV market

GM has two key approaches to EVs that convinced me personally that they are an exciting opportunity at these price points:

1. The Ultium platform.  The key to EV success is a platform approach where you can drive lower battery costs.   The modular approach is quite interesting as it allows for flexibility in battery arrangement for each vehicle

2. Cruise self driving system.  GM is the majority owner of what is widely rated as one of the top two self driving systems (the other is Waymo) by industry evaluators. 

Clearly the entire auto industry snoozed while Tesla ate their lunch but there are some other positives:

1. the list of products announced and are being delivered in the next 1-2 years is compelling with 30 models by 2025.  

2. GM has kept promises and now delivered a “mega SUV” - while Elon made broken  promises about the CyberTruck.  Originally targeted for 2021 carbuzz.com is now saying 2022 appears off the table as well.  Personally i find the hummer ev cooler than the cybertruck which for me atleast is a first (never been a GM design fan)

3. GM is also in the commercial delivery space with federal express, walmart and others.  BrightDrop is the new brand name for this offering

So, what are the negatives around? 

1. i grew up when GM meant crappy quality and mediocre cars.   Over the last 8 years however i have tested their SUVs vs other competitors and found they have highly competitive products.  

2. Do i love that GM got an unfair bailout/boost from the government vs Ford during the financial crisis? No.  But i can’t change the past

3. The recent recall by GM of the Volt.  Good news? No but all car companies have these (Tesla just had 500k recalled last week)

So as a disciplined investor who wants to play in this space i can either:
 
a) buy Tesla (1.14 trillion market cap / 369 p/e) and Rivion (83 billion / no earnings) or 

b) GM (93 billion / 8.5 PE) 

Yes before you write it Tesla has a higher gross margin but GM has a higher net…

Personally. I believe in mean reversion in the long term.  Is it sustainable for Tesla to be valued more than the rest of the auto industry combined? We will see.  I don’t see the global vehicle market doubling in size therefore something will have to give

One other note: Personally i find Elons laundry list of hype and broken promises difficult to accept - others clearly don’t mind, but I do love that he pushes the boundaries and can make an organization achieve more.  I hope other CEOs are learning this from him!"
169,2022-01-05 19:29:14,"Thoughts on ROKU?I bought some shares today because I noticed there’s been some recent consolidation after nearly a year of losses. Earnings seem to consistently beat projections and I feel good about their future. 

I’ve been watching their prices for a while and have been waiting for a buy opportunity but it’s been consistently dropping. ROKU’s high nearly topped off at $500 share price and right now it’s at a mere $200. It looks like it’s touching support so hopefully that doesn’t break the same day I bought lol. 

I just hope I’m not trying to catch a falling knife."
170,2022-01-05 19:06:45,"Why i raised my $RKLB price target to $70-$90 longtermRaising my long term price target on RKLB to $70. The more research I do on this company, the more I think it can go to $70-$100 within a few years. That’s a $30-$40 billion valuation by then. I really think that is possible given how the value premium attached to a successful launch track record is shaping up now and that Rocket Lab is diversifying into other aspects of space and not just launch. 

$30-$40 billion is still going to be a fraction of what SpaceX (valued at $100 billion privately and likely would be $150 billion to $200 billion if they were public) already is right now. And yes SpaceX has Starlink, but they won’t be allowed to have a monopoly and RKLB will serve customers that are competitors to Starlink at the very least even if they don’t do their own internet service. There’s so many possibilities here and they have plenty of capital and sources of funding to work with already.

Having early mover advantage is huge in the space sector and they’re in as good a position as possible to benefit from this and expand their capital base and operations. Neutron, the new launchpad in the eastern US, and the expansion into satellite systems will be huge factors. This might take years to play out but I don’t mind being even more patient and potentially paying the lower long term capital gains rate on profits if it works out. So RKLB to $70 is my new PT!!! It’s an investment, not a trade! (Not financial advice, just my opinion)"

172,2022-01-05 18:48:49,"PBFX - Shares outstanding historyNewbie question here.

PBFX tanked during COVID, obviously. But it never recovered. They cut their dividends significantly, so I think that had a lot to do with the lack of recovery.

However, I want to make sure there were no share issuances that may have impacted the price.

From my amateurish research I found they went from 18 million in 2014 to 84 million shares in 2019. As to the validation of that research? Who knows. Could be accurate or not. However, TD Ameritrade is reporting 62 million shares outstanding. Maybe 20 million are restricted?

Long story short I am trying to find out if PBFX will return to the old dividend, or did they reduce it due to issuance. I am having trouble trying to find out exactly when they did offer issuances or why they cut dividends and if the higher dividends might return in the near future.

I still see some upside with them but not as much as they’ve experienced this past year. 

On the other hand, VW stock seems to have plenty of room for growth. In the past two year they are only up 8% compared to 85% and 170% from GM and Ford. There P/E is only 5.3 compared to 8.9 (GM) and 34 (Ford). Most of the increase in stock price for GM and Ford has had to do with news surrounding the EVs they are making (I’m using GM and Ford as examples but VW has lagged pretty much all the large car manufacturers). VW is arguably one of the best positioned for EVs. They are investing $100 billion on EVs, their CEO is all bought in, they are looking at manufacturing their own batteries, and their ID4 has done pretty well with over 70,000 purchases.

Some key points delivered by T's CFO today:

* For the fourth quarter of 2021, AT&T delivered total postpaid net adds of 1.3 million, including approximately 880,000 postpaid phones.
* For the full-year 2021, postpaid phone net adds were 3.2 million, AT&T’s highest annual postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade as the company continues to benefit from strong network performance and its disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy.
* AT&T added approximately 270,000 fiber subscribers for the quarter. Full-year 2021 fiber net adds totaled about 1.0 million, the fourth consecutive year in which the company has added 1 million or more fiber subscribers. AT&T ended the year with an additional 2.6 million fiber customer locations, compared to its prior expectation of about 2.5 million.
* AT&T ended the year with approximately 73.8 million total global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, ahead of management’s prior guidance that end-of-year subscribers would be at the high end of its 70 million to 73 million subscriber target.

  
So who's buying today? I watched it go all the way down as I have an average position $28.50. I only re-entered as it hit $25 on the way back up."
188,2022-01-05 14:57:32,"Apple is really a perfect “Buy” company!!!Strong earnings and revenue growth year after year, without any “free year”.

Let’s look on their numbers, from the time when legendary Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public at the beginning of 2007.

It would be better to make some of calculations on a per share basis, like revenue and earnings per share. This will help neutralize changes in the stock base. If it’s shares dilution or shares buyback.

Revenue per Share growth from Sep. 2008 to Sep. 2021  – 14.62 Fold.

Earnings per Share growth from Sep. 2008 to Sep. 2021 – 23.82 Fold.

Yes it is really great results.

Let’s look into the PS chart

[PS 1997 - today](https://postimg.cc/6TtjfKTL)

[PS 2010 - today](https://postimg.cc/vDhPPKVR)

  

The PS moving inside the envelope from 2 to 4 for more than 9 years, and then going up more and more up to 8.4. What is singling the problem in valuation of the stock.

Let’s see the numbers:

|| Sep-2013 | TTM | Growth |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Price to Sales | 2.6 | 8.4 | 323% |
| Revenue per Share | 6.552 | 21.691 | 330% |
| Earnings per Share | 1.420 | 5.610 | 396% |
| Month End Stock Price | 17.030 | 182.010 | 1069%|

  

So when the Revenue per Share increased 3.3 times, Share Price had grown tenfold. It’s look like share price is disconnected with reality right now. PS difference of 3.23 is exactly the difference between the real stock price and overvalued stock price.

Back to PS charts, last time it was so high when at Dec 2007 it was 6.54. But that time it was IPhone just released and it had a full potential for future growth. Today seems to that any new product coming from Apple.

Yes Apple is performing buybacks, and it’s paying dividends. But, buybacks started in 2013 with PS of 2.6 was a good idea. Prices to Sales is better metric for IT Company than regular Price to Book.  In regular, it is wise to perform a buybacks when PB is lower than 1, that time you are actually directly rewarded with hidden value. But not the story is about IT companies without regular infrastructure. It is better to look for PE or PS. And yes it was wise to buyback shares when it was 2.6. But it not a smart idea to do this when it 8.4. You are actually paying too much for the same business.

What if to eliminate share buyback influence of per share data and look into the absolute numbers (mill. of dollars).

|| 2013 | TTM | Growth |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Revenue | 170,910| 365,817 | 212% |
| Market Cap. | 428,781 | 2,990,000 | 696.4% |

&#x200B;

So when the revenue grew only 2 times from 2013, the market cap is grew up 7 times more.

It is easily calculated, that with valuation from 2013 the market cap of Apple will be 909,016 millions of dollars.

So, what will be the possible share price of Apple? If Fed finally will stop printing money, one the possible valuation for Apple will be much lower than today. 

With average revenue growth for last 9 years is 10.58% the possible valuation for Apple the next year could be 1,005,144.48. It could a possible best storm ever, when markets power will hit improper valuation of a lot of companies, it will hit also the revenue side of apple, and within this situation, Apple’s management will hold on of buyback program. As usual, buying stocks when it expensive, not buying when it is cheap. Buy high, sell low.

And the real difference is from 2008 that is there is not any good product like IPhone going out right now. And it is really bad situation for all who believe that price of the Apple stock never will go down

Do I bet against Apple? Never! It is still perform shares buyback and it’s paying dividends. But I will never buy Apple shares today."

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

199,2022-01-05 13:04:00,"Hyundai Heavy Industries, Palantir to build new big data platformHyundai Heavy Industries and US company Palantir Technologies will work on building a new big data platform, the companies said Wednesday. 

The two firms clinched a partnership in Las Vegas a day before the official kickoff of the CES 2022. The deal is reportedly valued at above $25 million, according to the industry.

Their multiyear deal will improve the way Hyundai Heavy’s affiliates operate their businesses in shipbuilding, offshore engineering and energy and industrial machinery through Palantir’s data analysis software, Hyundai Heavy Industries said. 

Once the platform is set up, the companies will create a joint venture to commercialize the new platform service through sales and development. The joint venture is expected to help firms gain traction with global industrial companies. 

Hyundai Heavy has been promoting its Future of Shipyard strategy in an effort to create the industry’s first smart shipyard by 2030.

From planning to production, the entire process will be connected online and to smart devices real time. Palantir’s big data platform will be used to make that idea a reality, the company said. 

“With cooperation with Palantir, the group’s core businesses are expected to gain more competitiveness, marking a great turning point to transform the company’s working culture to become data-based,” Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings CEO Chung Ki-sun."

203,2022-01-05 11:21:28,"Ørsted: a brief introduction(formerly **DONG Energy**) is a Danish power company based in Denmark. It is the largest energy company in Denmark.  As of 2020, the company is the world's largest developer of [offshore wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power),  accounting for 29% of global installed capacity and producing 88% of their energy from renewable sources.  The company has a goal of net zero generation by the year 2025 and no carbon emissions by 2040. Since 2019, the company has been ranked the world's most sustainable energy company in the Corporate Knights Global 100 Index. 

According to its own statement, Ørsted's goal is to supply reliable clean energy. To this end, the company formulated its ""Strategy 85/15"" in 2009. According to Ørsted, 85% of its own electricity and heat production in 2009 still came from fossil fuels. The share of renewable energy was 15%. By 2040, Ørsted wanted to reverse this ratio and obtain 85% of its own electricity and heat production from renewables and 15% from natural gas. This strategy has since been overhauled. According to its own information, Ørsted will produce climate-neutral energy as early as 2025 and will completely dispense with fossil fuels.

The Danish Government holds the majority of Ørsted shares (50.1%) 

[The Hornsea Wind Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsea_Wind_Farm) phase one was completed in January 2021, with a capacity of 1,218 MW, making it the largest in the world on its completion.

Unfortunately, we can't eat EVs and Iphones :C I'm halfway expecting Monsanto, Nestle and the likes to drop in stock-value soon.

Seems like a time to pay attention to those.

As the younger generation is getting more and more into investing, I think it is needed to discuss the stocks that deliver basic goods like food, healthcare, clothes and such.

I know that this is common knowledge to the experienced stocktrader (aka. index), but the newer traders only seem interested in the tech companies.

Sure, the tech stocks will increase in value as more people invest, however there is a balance in everything, and as we draw money in to one field, we draw money out of another.

I'd love to know what percentage of redditors here beat that. You can achieve those gains with virtually no time commitment...just DCA into VOO or something similar.

That being said, obviously this is r/stocks and investing in stocks is much more fun that just dumping your money into an index fund (well, fun when you pick winners at least). For my portfolio, I've got about 50% weighting in VOO. Had some big winners (like Ford) and also a handful of losers (like PYPL). I'm going to continue investing in individual stocks because it's a fun hobby, but I may increase my VOO allocation from 50% to 60-75%. No shame in that.

I bought in at $60.00 (third red line). My thinking was I would wait for a considerable bounce up, as to not buy into a dead cat bounce.  
The first red line it bounced but didn't really go anywhere, so I waited and sure enough it dropped below the previous low, though so much so that it invalidated a double bottom.  
When it rose again, I watched to see if it would go above the previous high and sure enough it did. I also saw $60.00 as an important psychological level that I bought in there and the overall market was improving. Whether it would go straight up or dip a bit (as it did) was anyone's guess imo. The RSI wasn't that too high either. It dipped a bit but then went up and remained above $60.00 for about 1.5 hours.   


It then crashed below $60.00 later in the day, how could I predict this? Luckily it didn't go below the previous low which created support to bounce up and close at $60.25.  


How could I of played this better? By the way, this is for long term holding, not day trading.

239,2022-01-04 19:29:57,"Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet. Are these worth investing in for 2022? Will they still manage to meet expections?Nvidia, AMD, and Apple were honestly some of my best performing stocks in 2021.

I also purchased some **3x Leveraged** Nvidia and Apple shares last year for an experiment and at one point I was up nearly 900% with Nvidia (now it's just 500% due to the recent price fall).

Now since I already have over $10k in S&P and a couple of thousands in MSCI World Index, I am seriously considering throwing $5-10k into the 5 stocks mentioned in the title of the post. But is that a good idea?

Have Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet had their fair share of growth for now and will they just cool off in 2022 and wipe most of their gains from 2021? Or will they shoot higher?

I guess I'm just asking for validation here before I throw in 5-10k into those stocks. From what I read on the internet, market sentiment is largely positive towards those companies.

I am not adding Tesla to this list because I'm not really confident that their growth last year was organic. Maybe I should add Facebook at least?

**EDIT:**

Forgot to mention that I want to put 50% of that amount into ***leveraged shares*** (3x) of the said companies. I do understand that if the underlying stock goes down by 33.3% in one day,  I'm basically done. But 33.3% down for companies of such caliber in a SINGLE day would be probably happening alongside a total market crash, no?"

246,2022-01-04 17:57:25,"Tesla valuation is really crazyNot shitting on Tesla. I am not a bear as well. Just making a statement. I like Tesla. I recently did some research(average joe research) regarding electric cars and Tesla is really ahead of the curve in one aspect. Their quality might not be great but as long as the car works and does what’s it supposed to do for 10 years I guess it’s acceptable. But the one aspect where they are ahead is their solid charging network. 

But the reason I say it’s got a over bloated valuation is because of the below excerpt from a CNN article. 

“As recently as 2005, Toyota was No. 4 in US sales, with GM, Ford and what was then known as DaimlerChrysler all in front, with a combined 57% of US sales between them. But in 2021, GM, Ford and Stellantis — the European automaker that owns Chrysler — had only 38% of the US market between them in the first nine months of the year. Even adding in Tesla only gets the US automakers to just over 40% of sales.” 

The last line shows that Tesla staggering sales only adds up to 2 percent of US sales but it’s valuation is 2% of the total US stock market valuation( 48 trillion)."

250,2022-01-04 16:56:51,"If you're looking for entry points after selloffs, look for base formationWe all know that growth stocks have been hit hard and selloffs provide a great buying opportunity for good quality stocks. The hard part, however, is determining when to enter. An effective strategy is to watch for bases to form. For a super quick overview of the basing pattern, look here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basing.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basing.asp)

Depending on a number of factors, bases can take weeks or months to form. The reason why it is an effective strategy is because a basing pattern reflects a balance between demand and selling pressure - and after a selloff this is an indication that selling pressure is easing and demand is starting to hold the price from further selloffs. The longer and tighter the base, the better. There are two steps to buying bases:

1) Identify a base under formation

2) Wait for a buy signal, which is a bullish breakout from the base

For some concrete examples of stocks I'm currently watching, have a look at the charts of PYPL and DOCU. Both have sold off pretty hard but both are solid companies poised to rebound when the dust settles. Both are in the process of forming bases.

PYPL: Base is still young and a bit volatile, so it likely needs a bit more time to tighten. Then I would look to add on a break above $200.

DOCU: Shaping up nicely because the base is forming within the context of an ascending wedge, which is a bullish pattern. You can see how the volatility is diminishing as the price consolidates right around the bottom of the selloff gap. A continuation of this pattern followed by a break above $160 would provide a good low risk entry point."

None of my friends are interested in learning with me and I don't know where to look for a mentor.

253,2022-01-04 16:42:29,"Margin control formulasAs this is asked frequently in different subs I thought I put it here for further reference.

First of all: **do not invest on margin** if you don't understand exactly what you are doing. It is very dangerous and you have to control the risk.

Now to control the risk you cannot rely on your broker. Some brokers will issue a margin call, others will just start to liquidate your positions when your equity goes down. Don't let this happen, control the risk yourself and act yourself before the broker does.

First you define how much you want to invest on margin. Say you want to take a loan of 20% then your  are at 120%. Then define a maximum level before you start liquidating your positions yourself. This multiple must be lower than the maximum your broker would give you. Say you declare this to be 300% (which is quiet high, but some brokers even give you 800% or more with portfolio margin).

The formula which you can use in a spreadsheet should tell you to which level the value of your portfolio may tank before you have to take action. This is the formula:

D=Debt

Mmax=maximum margin before you have to act

Vmin=minimum value your positions may fall to

V=actual value

ST=Stress tolerance. That much your positions may lose before you have to act.

Vmin=D\*Mmax/(Mmax-100%)

ST=(V-Vmin)/V

Sorry, I'm no mathematician. I use those formulas in spreadsheets to control my risk in strategies with margin. The most important number is Vmin. Whenever the value of your stocks comes near that or even under that number you have to take action, say close positions.

Example: you have 100'000 and want to invest 120% on margin. You want to get out at 300% margin.

Vmin=20000\*300/(300-100) = 30000

ST=(120000-30000)/120000 = 75%

You have a stress tolerance of 75%. Bare in mind that in this example you lose 90% of your capital before you have to take action! Without margin you can lose close to 100% without having to take action and therefore have a stress tolerance of almost 100% (the broker probably would close your account if all your holdings go to zero and there is no cash left...)."

Young beginner investor here. I'm currently sitting on 50k in a TSFA parked in Wealth Simple's Robo investor at 9 risk (heavy saver, don't really do much and not making tons of money).

I'm 27 years old and I'm nervous about the housing economy here in Canada.

Maybe there's some other ideas to consider, otherwise I'll keep DCAing itno the portfolio wealthsimple built.

Edit:

For clarification, I see where I went wrong with comparing the current situation to the 2008 recession. There were specific reasons for why that recession occurred.

259,2022-01-04 15:52:53,"U.S. manufacturers grow in December at slowest pace in 11 months as omicron strikesAmerican manufacturers in December matched their slowest pace of growth in 11 months as they coped with persistent labor and material shortages and braced for a fresh onslaught from the omicron strain of the coronavirus. 

A closely followed index of U.S.-based manufacturers dropped to 58.7% in the final month of 2021 compared to 61.1% in November, the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday. Any number above 50% signals expansion and readings above 60% are considered exceptional.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to slip to 60%.

The ISM results are drawn from a survey of senior business executives. The index tends to give a good snapshot of the health of the U.S. economy. 

**Big picture:** Manufacturers have plenty of demand for new cars, electronics, furniture and the like, but they are likely to remain under strain until all the shortages ease up.

Omicron doesn’t help matters. The very contagious strain is likely to make it harder for manufacturers to keep production lines going at full tilt due to employees missing work after catching the virus. Yet they have been less affected by the coronavirus than businesses that deal with customers face to face.

I really don't want to ignore inflation completely since I want my model to have the highest R-Squared possible.

276,2022-01-04 11:44:28,"I hope someone can help clarify my biggest fear about stock investingStocks is obviously a risk. You can alot depending on a company's performance. You can earn lesser amount of money for a safer long term investment but that too is risky in case company suddenly has to face some problems and they have to declare bankruptcy. 

So my fear and question is how do people choose which company to invest in for long term without worrying if that company will go bankrupt, And totally dissolve and disappear? 

For example Chrysler went bankrupt and it was saved by fiat. So it didn't dissolve. Conseco managed to get out of bankruptcy. Etc. 

So how to be confident to invest in stock without worrying that a company will disappear along with all of your investment? Or is it that companies come back from bankruptcy and your money can be saved?"
277,2022-01-04 11:28:12,"Buy rumor/Sell news: Why did TSLAI've been doing about a year and a half of investing/swing trading, and some things still surprise me. 

I learned that you buy the rumor and sell the news. usually stocks dip after major positive announcements that fit the expectations. So I expected to TSLA to dip at least slightly after people take profits on a pretty obvious Q4 sales numbers report. 

People knew that Tesla would exceed earnings, and delivery predictions for Q4. So why did the stock go up 14% after the announcement? 

I understand that TSLA isn't a typical stock in terms of stock price movements because of the fanbois and media coverage. But I'd still want to apply this to general investing principles and strategies that I should watch out for, or that I missed this time around.

Edit: thanks for answering my questions. Really appreciate it."
278,2022-01-04 11:27:10,"Here's another one- Which of the following would you invest $50k in for 2022?I know posts like these are common but at this point I need a fresh set of eyes, perspective, and knowledge to help me make a better decision. 

I recently opened a SEP IRA with Vanguard and am considering my options for 2022. I have been historically investing in ETF's for a few years now, particularly, VOO and some VONG in the past year. Initially, my intention was to buy $58k worth of VOOG or VONG and just forget it but after missing on some gains in 2021, I've been considering investing in individual stocks rather than index investing as well.  

I refuse to buy any speculative plays with this money and so I have narrowed down to a few individual stocks that I feel will continue to grow into the future (not just 2022) and would appreciate all and ay input. I'm going to start with the big three, of course. 

1. AAPL: seems like a very safe play. There is a potential, new, smaller iPhone coming out and with their foray into processors recently they have been on fire. I don't think AAPL is going anywhere anytime soon but I am a little worried about their lack of expansion into more of the cloud computing space, than, say, MSFT or others. 
2. MSFT: I think I remember when this stock was $50 something dollars... However, I am having a hard time purchasing it at $330 something right now. I don't believe it is overvalued but the price growth makes me cautious. Regardless, I would buy and hold this even at these levels. 
3. GOOG: I haven't looked too much into but this GOOG seems like a very safe bet as well, however, besides ""expert"" ratings, I really haven't looked too much into it. frankly, I've been a little anti- google for years but can't ignore that this is a great play. 

Others that I am considering and would like some input on:

ASML, and TSM - did someone say chip shortage? they just had a fire at one of their factories (I think damage is minimal) but this seems like a great stock to hold and buy long term, however, TSM seems a lot more attractive and cheaper at $130 something. I do believe they are one of the few, larger, compnies that have capabilities to manufacture chips and are in a great position to grow with AMD, NVDA and others' thirst for semiconductors.

&#x200B;

Others: CRM, NET, CRWD, PANW, MRVL similar as above. I've done some research on these stocks and while PANW seems like a very bet I would like some input on the rest of these. 

RNG- this one, I have no idea. They've lost so much in the last year, yet, it a ""strong buy"" everywhere. I don't think the stock will bounce back soon but I could be completely wrong here.

I've been reading about DCA vs lump sump buying and would, ideally, like to invest it all in one stock but am open to ideas. In the grand scheme of things, $58k really isnt much, therefore would like to invest it in one stock.

&#x200B;

Thanks for all your input."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

290,2022-01-04 04:23:21,"Am I understanding selling covered calls correctly?I have been reading up on options trading and I was looking into selling covered calls. I was wanting to make sure I understand the potential risks correctly.

So let's say I hold 100 shares of XYZ company for $25/share. I want to sell a covered call for, let's say a week out. I put a strike price of $27/share and let's say the options are $0.15 each. I only have 100 shares so I sell one contract and gain $15 (minus any fees). If the share price does not exceed $27 by expiration, the call is highly unlikely to be exercised by the buyer so I essentially profit the $15 (minus fees) that I earned selling the option.

Now if the price goes up to, let's say, $28/share, the call is likely to be exercised, and I'm forced to sell my 100 shares for $27/each. In this scenario, I have gained the $15 premium (minus fees), but now I've also sold for $2 profit per share for an additional $200, but the risk here is I missed out on potentially another $100 if I had not sold the options to begin with. While this limits the profit made on the shares themselves, it's also not necessarily bad because I didn't lose any capital, either.

And finally, let's say the share price goes down to $22/share. The call is extremely unlikely to be exercised and I just pocketed the premium for selling the call. But, if for some weird reason the call gets exercised, it's not bad because I just sold the shares for $27 each when they are only trading at $22 each now. Obviously highly unlikely the call would be exercised, but just wanted to throw this scenario in just to make sure I understand all possibilities.

And, regardless of any other scenario, if I buy back the option I sold before expiration and before it was exercised, I basically pay the current market value, which ideally is less than what I initially sold it for, so I still pocket some money, but not quite the full initial premium.

Is all the above correct? And am I missing anything that I should know before diving into it?

And another question about actually selling the contract. If I only own 100 shares, obviously I can only ""afford"" to have one call exercised. Would this stop me from potentially selling multiple options, maybe 1 per week or month, and if one were to get exercised I would just close out the remainder? Or am I only allowed to have one ""active"" contract per 100 shares I earn, preventing me from selling another with a different expiration if I already have one out?

Thank you in advance!"

310,2022-01-03 21:49:24,"Visa (V) vs PayPal (PYPL)**Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now**

**(This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better)**

I have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal.

However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.

**Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently)**

Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market.  I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?

Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.

**Growth**

Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%

PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01

While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32

Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.

**Dividend**

PayPal has no dividends currently

VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years.

&#x200B;

**Margins**

Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through.

PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s.

**Concerns**

For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor.

**Overall,**

The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa."

***Disclaimer: There will be no market recap tomorrow since I will be travelling back to my home after the holidays.***

Stocks rose in the first trading session of the year as the three major indexes continued to hover near record-highs, building on the momentum from last week. As has been the case for weeks, market participants continue to digest surging coronavirus Omicron cases

The S&P 500 (SPY), which tracks the performance of the five-hundred largest companies in the US, posted another year of amazing gains, rising roughly 27% in 2021. Within the S&P 500, the energy and real estate sectors outperformed, gaining more than 42% each during the year for these sectors' best annual gains on record.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.58%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.96%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.65%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.29%
* Tesla (TSLA): +13.53%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.50%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -3.66%
* AMD: +4.41%
* Daimler (DMLRY): -17.51%

According to Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin, the five largest components of the S&P 500 (or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google) together returned 37% last year – and now constitute about 23% of the entire index.

Kostin said, “In 2022, variables associated with earnings and valuation will determine the performance of the S&P 500 index and its underlying constituents. Goldman Sachs now expects the S&P 500 (SPY) to climb roughly 7% in 2022 to end at $510.

And indeed, this week investors will be eyeing new economic data including the Labor Department's December jobs report to help show the relative strength of U.S. economic growth in the final weeks of the year, as inflation concerns and labor shortages continued to ripple across the country. Risks around the latest surge of the coronavirus are also weighing, with impacts to the labor market from the Omicron variant potentially set to show in the final monthly jobs report for 2021.

Unfortunately, the highly contagious coronavirus Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly throughout the US and the world. The US seven-day rolling average of cases neared 400,000 on Saturday, by far the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic and more than double the average registered on Christmas Day, according to the Financial Times data tracker.

Fortunately, the data suggests that while more contagious, the Omicron variant is less severe compared to previous strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains.

**Highlights**

* After gaining more than 2% today, Apple (AAPL) became the first company in history to break the $3 trillion market cap.
* Construction spending in the U.S. rose at a 0.4% monthly clip in November, the Commerce Department said on Monday. This matched October's rate, which was in turn upwardly revised from the 0.2% monthly increase previously reported.
* The purchasing manager’s index for the manufacturing sector came in slightly lower than expected, reflecting continued supply-side disruptions. The PMI came in at 57.7, the lowest print in over a year.
* On Sunday, Tesla (TSLA) reported Q4 deliveries that far exceeded Wall Street estimates, which is only made more impressive when one considers how traditional automakers like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors have slashed production due to the semiconductor shortage.  Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, far higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles.
* The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced worldwide sales of semiconductors were $48.8 billion in October 2021, an increase of 24.0% from the October 2020 total of $39.4 billion and 1.1% more than the September 2021 total of $48.3 billion. Additionally, a report from Euler Hermes showed expected semi sales growth of 9% for 2022.
* A.A. Milne's 1926 book ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" was among the many classic works to lapse into the public domain in the United States. Since Milne's work is no longer protected by copyright, the text can be freely published by any company, while the characters and setting of the book can be adapted by any producer or studio.

313,2022-01-03 21:03:43,"Corsair's Creator Economy Moat 

Last year, it became obvious that the content creator economy is inevitable. In just 40 days, Mr. Beast spent over $3.5 million to make an under 26-minute video of his own “Squid Game”. That’s more than 3x the cost per minute of the actual show on Netflix. Barely a month later that video has over 193 million views on YouTube, making it not only the most viewed video ever that isn’t a music video or movie trailer, but also giving it more views than the original Squid Game itself. And that doesn’t even count the 30 million views it has on Facebook and millions more on other platforms. It’s undeniable that making content, whether through TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, wherever, is the next mainstream. The creator economy is the next media supercycle and everyone from entrepreneurs to marketers are racing to catch up with this reality. But creators need suppliers for the gear they need to make content; and despite near-term demand issues, There’s a strong argument that no company is better poised to take advantage of this long-term trend than Corsair.

# A Cultural Moat With Streamers

Short-run issues that I will get to notwithstanding, the most powerful thing Corsair has is its cultural moat among streamers and content creators. With no analysts covering the company being in this audience and likely not active viewers on platforms like Twitch, this moat is also the least discovered or most misunderstood aspect of the company. There’s a reason that Corsair is in the top three for market share in creator gear and out-competing larger peers despite having just a third of the sales of Logitech.

What is this moat though? As someone that doesn’t just have peripherals for working at home, but rather to also live stream and make content, the answer is simple in my mind. Corsair made the decision early in the game to specifically target and engage with streamers as potential customers and have built an almost impenetrable positive relationship with the content creator community in the process. Some of this is the company having a first-mover advantage in establishing itself in this market. They were collaborating with streamers on Twitch and putting themselves up for connections since the very first TwitchCon in 2015, far before peers began to realize the potential in the space and back when Twitch had a fifth of the viewers that it does today. Corsair also injected itself into the eSports scene early and remains dominant in the area, sponsoring several teams and partnering with teams to release custom controllers through their acquired company, Scuf Gaming. With professional gamers often turning to content creation on their own or being creators prior to going pro, it creates a positive feedback loop where Corsair can continually grow itself into these communities further.

Positive sentiment alone begins to create a powerful moat but alone would not create what Corsair has today. That comes with one of the smartest acquisitions that I’ve ever seen in this industry with Elgato Gaming.

# Elgato… The Streamer Supplier

While product improvement is a must to stay ahead in this space, and Corsair certainly does this with over $100 million in annual R&D, their moat and competitive position is solidified by Elgato. Acquired in 2018, Elgato transformed Corsair’s position in the streaming industry. They went from a traditional supplier of peripherals, an early entrant but one whose position could be threatened, to the sole supplier of items necessary for streaming that could not be replicated by any peer. Yes, that’s how important this acquisition was. And it’s a key component to the growth of Corsair as a company, as emphasized by management comments in their public filings:

>Net revenue of the gamer and creator peripherals segment increased $245.2 million, or 83.4%, in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to strong sales growth in sales of Elgato branded streaming products

Elgato, while selling gear specified for streaming, has obvious competition for items like green screens, lighting, and audio. What it does not have competition in is defining product, the Stream Deck. I am being completely serious when I say this thing is not optional for anyone who wants to take streaming even slightly seriously. Every big streamer has it, and for good reason. 

I know it’s a buzzword used all the time, but Elgato’s focus on catering towards streamers does create a strong ecosystem for the company in convincing customers to use them for a larger share of their streaming gear, this being despite some of their products oftentimes coming in at a higher price point than peers due to product specification for the target audience. This has positive impacts on the non-Elgato parts of Corsair as well, with streamers using Elgato products being more inclined to buy Corsair peripherals. For example, I bought my current Corsair keyboard because I already had a Stream Deck. This is the same for countless other streamers. This extends beyond just peripherals too. Scuf’s space in the controller market and Origin’s in the PC building space allows for Corsair as a parent company to capitalize on every piece of gear that a content creator may need, and it all stems from their moat as a provider of a necessity for streamers with their culture engrained in the creator community.

# A Transforming Company

The result of this moat is that Corsair’s future path has changed to be oriented with the future of the content creator economy rather than being tied to the gaming market like it was in the past. It may not be obvious yet, but if you look close enough, you can already see the underlying shift beginning to happen. Corsair’s traditional memory business grows at what appears to be a near-terminal rate, (under 10% projected growth from 2020 to the end of 2023), and their “Other Gaming Components and Systems” segment, while substantially outpacing memory in growth, isn’t the most intriguing area to look at in Corsair. The moat in the content creation market obviously makes the Gamer & Creator Peripherals segment the standout part of the company. And if you look at the numbers, it makes sense as to why. The Gamer & Creator peripherals segment, driven by Elgato and streaming gear, **went from being the smallest segment of the business in 2020 to being forecast to be the largest part of the business in 2021**. Even though it barely scrapes by as the largest, projected to be 34.6% of 2021 sales, it’s a stark change from 2018 when it was only 24.9% of sales. This revenue share is expected to grow further in the coming years, with the mean forecast showing 37.9% of sales by the end of 2023. It wouldn’t surprise me if the reality turned out to be higher. A testament to this evolution in sales makeup can be found in search trends. While the data is somewhat noisy since Corsair as a word is searched for reasons other than the company, (it means privateer), and Corsair’s company phrase has volume conflated with stock price spikes, (thanks WallStreetBets), a change is still clear. Searches for the Elgato Stream Deck were higher than searches for Corsair’s company specifically in 2021 for the first time, showing a definitive change in the tides. 

This doesn’t even touch on the higher margins that this segment has or its better resiliency in the face of current supply chain and demand issues. Gamer and Creator peripherals have a 36.6% gross margin YTD compared to just 23.8% for the rest of the company. The growth rate is higher as well with gross profit not only up 42% for the peripherals area YTD compared to just 15% for the rest of the company. And the segment is proving to be more resilient to supply chain and demand pressures, with gross profit down 19% and 22% respectively from the year-ago quarter. That’s a lot of numbers, but it means that products that creators buy are both more profitable for Corsair, and resistant to demand slumps than the rest of the company.

The stronger demand and profitability likely won’t change due to the inevitability of the creator economy. Nvidia global marketing manager Brandon Ewing, who is also one of the top 1,000 streamers on Twitch under the name “Atrioc”, has shared industry knowledge with his audience frequently. He’s explained that marketing spend is quickly shifting towards content creators and claims that 2022 will be a major year where this change accelerates. If you’ve seen what creators like Mr. Beast are starting to do as they scale up, it becomes a lot easier to accept this fact. There’s a reason one of the top answers kids say for jobs they want to have when they grow up is “YouTuber”. The ramifications of this change give a long-run secular tailwind to companies in this space that Corsair is uniquely positioned to capitalize on with their moat.

# The Holdups

I do want to be explicitly clear, while I believe that the content creation supercycle is an item that Corsair is poised to reap benefits from in the long run, it does not mean that I am endorsing the stock as a must-have today. In fact, I’m not making a call on purpose. Because even though they’re a good company with obvious tailwinds, that doesn’t mean they’re a good stock. They do have issues and headwinds to deal with as well. I was talking with Renny Zucker, a wicked smart acquaintance on Twitter that I’ve known for over a year, and he had some wisdom that was quite useful…

>That someone can get every number on an earnings report right yet still lose money. At the end of the day, it’s the job of people covering companies to forecast what everyone else will think about earnings and news rather than what you think about it.

And right now, there are some overhangs on this company that everyone else isn’t happy about. The most glaring of which is the private equity firm that took Corsair public, Eagletree Capital. They bought almost all of Corsair in 2017 at a valuation of $525 million. Since the stock more than tripled initially after the IPO, they’ve been unloading their stake furiously. At the time of the IPO, they owned 77.62% of Corsair at a cost basis near $5.75. As a result, they don’t care what price they’re selling at because it’s a massive profit either way. In the first nine months after the IPO, Eagletree sold over 17 million shares or over 18% of the company on the open market. In fact, their sales were over 4.3% of the total stock volume during this period. With ownership over 54% as of mid-June and a commitment to continue selling, Eagletree continues to be a drag on the stock.

The other main issue now is demand. It just isn’t there in the gaming space. That’s not to say people just don’t want gear, but they don’t want it at the current prices. The semiconductor shortage, particularly in GPUs, has pushed prices up considerably in many of Corsair’s products. With the price elasticity of customers, many people are withholding from purchasing for the time being until prices come back towards more normal levels. While this is creating pent-up demand that will offset saturation from the 2020 pandemic buying surge, (inventory rising shows a level of confidence in this demand flow IMO), it’s still a major near-term issue. The current supply chain and demand issues also have negative impacts on margins, meaning profitability ratios will be worse until these issues abate.

# Conclusion

I’ll keep it short and sweet. Corsair is facing a dichotomy. A myriad of short-run issues is impacting both the performance of the company and the stock price. On the other side of the coin, Corsair has positioned itself beautifully to benefit from the upcoming content creation supercycle. It’s clear in my mind that Corsair is an excellent company. But is it a good stock? That’s not a question I can answer quite yet."

Also, earnings expense (rather than capitalize) the development of intangible assets. This unfairly punishes companies investing in intangibles even though they are a perfectly legitimate source of returns.

Yes that’s not always the case but mind you I was like 6 years old, it was a simple way of getting the basic concepts down.

One day on my way to my grandparents house, we passed by a McDonalds that had a packed line. As someone who loved McDonalds, along with this new knowledge in mind, I told my grandpa that I wanted to invest in McDonalds since their lines are always long (killer DD). Every year on my birthday he’d put some money into my account, and so he used some of this money and put it into McDonalds as 6 year old me asked.

Well, I’m in college now and have taken complete control of the account, but he still gets the trade confirmations emailed to him.

“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”"

1. This is an LP
2. UAN is urea ammonium nitrate, a product of the company, and also the ticker for CVR LP
3. It's high risk, and not because of the underlying fertilizer market, more on that at the end 

Let's set the stage here:  

Commodities.  They're hot.  But few are as hot as ammonia.  Fertilizer markets have gone crazy.  And by crazy, I mean [straight vertical.](https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2021/12/nitrogen-fertilizer-prices-above-expected-levels.html)  It's the result of a confluence of factors.  Nitrogen fertilizer production capacity very closely tracks demand.  CVR LP's plants, for example, average about 95% utilization over the last 3 years.  About 90% of that goes to crop fertilization.  So, when hurricane Ida and winter storm Uri hit production facilities on the gulf over the last 12 months, supply was constrained.  Additionally, rising corn prices mean that the optimum nitrogen application increased, and total corn planted -which is a nitrogen hungry crop- also increased.  This demand increase exacerbated the supply shortage.  Gas shortages in Europe have idled plants across the pond, further constricting supply.  Because production already closely tracks demand, playing catchup is a slow process.  The result of all this is that straight vertical line on that U of I graph.  

And farmers are willing to pay it.  The difference between $3.50 corn and $5.50 corn is huge.  Say Farmer X has a fixed 5  year cash rent agreement  on land signed when corn was $3.50, and it brought their cost of production to $3.15 -- 10% gross margins.  All things equal with that same lease, you're making 42.5% gross margins with post pandemic $5.50 corn.  It's absolutely critical nitrogen be applied every year for a corn crop.  If the price of nitrogen goes from $40 an acre to $140, who cares?  Farmer X is going to pay it and still make money.  ROIC of optimal nitrogen application is huge, so much that $1400/ton ammonia will stop few, if any, Midwest farmer with corn at $5.50.  A bit of an aside, but it's important to set the stage, this isn't necessarily an unsustainable squeeze.  Farmers can and will pay $1400 a ton for nitrogen in 2022.

Anyways, we can now start on CVR partners.  They own two fertilizer plants, one in Kansas and one between Illinois and Iowa.  The typical feedstock for ammonia production is Natural gas, but the Coffeyville, Kansas plant uses gasified pet coke.  CVR hasn't been doing so hot over the last 5 years.  Referring back to that fertilizer chart from the U of I, Ammonia has been in a bit of a bear market.  CF, their largest competitor and the largest nitrogen fertilizer maker in the US, has cost advantages, a cleaner balance sheet, and they managed to eek out profits over the last few years.  CVR LP has not.  They started over levered coming into the bear market, and by 2020, they were *really* over levered.  As a result, their debt was horrifying.  $625MM at 9.25%, $64MM annual interest payments.  Compared to a market cap of $350MM at the end of 2019, and revenue of $350MM in 2020, they were on the verge of collapse with common unitholders SOL.  

When fertilizer prices started going up, they capitalized well.  They refinanced their debt.  They've reduced their debt load to $550MM at 6.125%.  Their annual debt payments are cut in half, from $64MM to \~$34MM.  As a company worth $350MM in 2019.  That's almost 10% annual cashflow yield from 2019 prices freed up from their refi alone.  One could argue that a $40 price hike from 2019 levels without any consideration to the improvement of the nitrogen fertilizer market is warranted.  

The thesis gets better.  Recall the absurd rise in nitrogen prices.  I built a model from CVR's previous operating results.  [Most of the data comes from their 10K, pg. 31-34.](https://investors.cvrpartners.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&page=4)  And I want to preface this, [CME UAN futures are flat over the next year.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/agriculture/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola.quotes.html)  And yeah, futures prices are necessarily predictive of the future price, but given the earlier discussion about the inelasticity of production and demand among farmers, I think it a reasonable estimate.  Ammonia cycles tend to move slowly, riding highs and lows for years.  The extraordinary nature of the recent price movements means the cycle will likely move faster this time.  A 1 year hold at current prices seems reasonable, if not expected.  

A few notes about my model:

*  UAN prices for 2022 are a mild discount to wholesale futures
* Wholesale ammonia prices, as their is no derivate I can use, are estimated at the historical average of \~2x UAN.  UAN's plants have better proximity to the corn belt than CF's and the $1060 estimate for wholesale ammonia is likely a sandbag.
* Natural gas is an average of 2022 Futures
* I assume a reduction in sales volume for 2022, along with increased opex exclusive of feedstocks.
* As their is no pet coke index for their Coffeyville feedstock, I assume a doubling from 2019 levels.  They have a contract with CVR energy indexed to UAN prices with a ceiling of $40, though I imagine that's too little and CVR E will be filling as little of that as possible.  More on the GP-LP relationship at the end. 

Anyways:  [Here it is](https://imgur.com/a/Fme5qC8).  I'm am neither a CFA or an artist, so it's no pretty.  Nor does it need to be pretty, the numbers speak for themselves.  2022 distributable FCF should be \~$50 assuming steady prices, and another $5 or so for Q4 last year.  My interest expense is a little high, that's obviously not the star of the show.   

Hence, at $85 a share.  I think UAN is significantly undervalued.  If their future FCF was worth $40 a share in 2019, when their equity value was $350MM, and their debt payments $64MM, shouldn't be worth much more today with a likely $55 per share of distributions possible over the next 5 quarters, and $30MM of perpetual annual FCF freed up from their debt refinancing?  

Equity holders in all nitrogen fertilizers companies have benefitted over the last 12 months -- Central Farmers, Nutrien, etc., but I don't think the market fully appreciates how much UAN's common equity holders gain.  If we think the value of an equity the sum of it's future cashflows, agnostic of the improved fertilizer market, $UAN has added $550MM next year, plus $30MM perpetually, and is only worth $500MM more than it was in 2019.  It looks stupid cheap.  

And, if I've done a good job with my pitch here, you should be thinking ""gee, u/thri54, that sounds like a smoking deal.  What's the catch?"" 

**Important:**   The catch is the structure.  It's horrific.  And not ""ahh, I don't wont to file a k-1"" horrific.  CVR LP's GP is CVR Energy, which is majority controlled by Carl Icahn.  There is a structure map on page 5 of the 10k.  And, uh, I think their disclosure says it best:  

>Our general partner, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy, has fiduciary duties to CVR Energy and its stockholders, and the interests of CVR Energy and its stockholders may differ significantly from, or conflict with, the interests of our public common unitholders.  
>  
>Our general partner is responsible for managing us. Although our general partner has fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner that is in our best interests, the fiduciary duties are specifically limited by the express terms of our partnership agreement, and the directors and officers of our general partner also have fiduciary duties to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to CVR Energy and its stockholders. The interests of CVR Energy and its stockholders may conflict with, the interests of our public common unitholders. In resolving these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests, the interests of CVR Services, its sole member, or the interests of CVR Energy and holders of CVR Energy’s common stock, including its majority stockholder, an affiliate of Icahn Enterprises L.P., over our interests and those of our common unitholders. 

So there's your catch.  The LP says they have no fiduciary duty to common unit holders.  CVR Energy itself owns 36% of the commons, and that's all the protection you get as a shareholder, a hopeful mutual best interest between CVR Energy and CVR LP, that Icahn won't try to find some way to cheat the future profits out of the commons.  

I mentioned that CVR LP's Kansas plant uses gasified pet coke as a feedstock.  Well, they have a deal with CVR Energy to buy pet coke at a rate indexed to the price of UAN (the product), with a ceiling of $40.  UAN prices exploded, and so did coal prices.  And, all of a sudden, CVR Energy can't find enough pet coke to feed CVR LP.  CVR LP has to buy on the open market over $40.  Full disclosure, I haven't researched the exact cause, but I wouldn't put it past Icahn and company to sell the coke on the open market to a middleman above their contract price ceiling.  Things like this are concerning.  

So, $UAN looks promising, but you have to accept that the risk that the GP has a license to fleece the common unit holders.  Are they really going to screw over CVR LP holders?  It's hard to say.  It would damage the reputation of Icahn Enterprise subsidiaries on public markets if they did, as much as that is possible.  But, at the same time, when FCF = 75% of the unit price of the next 5 months alone... it's certainly tempting for the GP to screw over equity holders.

I have a small position in the commons.  If I had protections over the GP it'd be the largest position in my portfolio.  I think the risk/reward of the business itself is incredible, but the risk that the GP screws over the commons is to great for me to warrant a large position. 

NFA

&#x200B;

**TLDR**:  Incredible opportunity in commodities if you trust Carl Icahn to hand you the profits in good faith.  Caveat emptor."

I’m at the point where I’d rather sit in cash than buy stocks at this time. Every stock I look at has a P/E of 30-40, and often into the hundreds. I see that PSEC has a less than 4 P/E ratio and pays a great dividend, so that’s tempting, but I still see it as volatile enough to go down 20% in a crash.

I know inflation is officially only less that 7% so far, but it’s already priced into the market given the crazy inflated environment.

According to the IRS we have to pay tax on every cent we make and deduct losses for every cent we lose.

On paper I did not make a profit or loss but I technically made a loss because the 100 dollars was more valuable in jan than in December. The 100 dollars of Jan Is really worth only 93 dollars in Dec due to 7% inflation. 

since it’s technically valued less are there any deductions for this loss of value?? And how come this was never addressed because unless money is invested the value of cash drops.

Total novice here. I’ve done quite a bit of reading on the basics of investing on Reddit, couch potato, investopedia, and some other resources.

That being said, I’m not entirely comfortable investing in certain sectors or companies.. and so I’ve been looking for other, more ethical options.. preferably an ETF(s) to start out with.

350,2022-01-03 08:39:31,"Anyone have experience reporting wash sale around end of year?In a somewhat annoying situation.  My understanding is that I can only NOT recognize the loss if I have bought shares of the company recently and still own them. But if I've bought shares, sold for a loss, bought shares (vested, espp in this case) and then sold AGAIN I can realize that loss since i've effectively undone the wash trade by selling all of the shares. Is this correct? Details:



100 RSUs vest Dec 10. Are taxed based on value of 50 per share. RSUs are distributed and sold Dec 13 for 45 per share (500 loss).

10 RSUs are bought for 38 VIA ESPP on Dec 15 (carries forward that loss on purchase) and immediately sold at 45 (70 dollar short term gain, i think- but more importantly, I am now realizing that -500 loss here, since I've sold all my shares despite the espp purchase being a wash trade).

Except I then have another 25 shares vesting Jan 4 (still within 30 day window). My understanding is that this makes my ESPP a wash sale too, in which case the loss from the first sale is carried forward onto the second round of shares vesting and means I cannot recognize that -500 loss.

I can then claim that loss for 2022 if I sell those Jan shares regardless of when I sell, so long as I sell without another purchase in the next 31 days.

Is this correct? Anyone been in a similar situation?"

360,2022-01-02 23:03:15,"Understanding discrepancies in various pe/peg ratios for same companyPlease, can anyone explain why, e.g. Fidelity lists NVDA's pe ratio as 104.85 and peg as 2.66 but Charles Schwab and others list them as 90.79 and 2.33, respectively. At first, I thought maybe it was a difference between Non-GAAP and GAAP earnings, but that doesn't seem to be the issue. Also, both Fidelity and Schwab say they use TTM. So I wondered if TTM did not necessarily mean last 4 QTR, but was a calculation of estimated months that hadn't yet been reported or something?

Most stocks have the same values, but I've noticed a couple of discrepancies in stocks I own. The largest is UMC, which Fidelity lists as pe as 22.08 and peg as 0.76. Schwab list them as 15.69 and 0.54, respectively. A very significant difference!

What's more confusing, is when I calculate the pe/peg ratios myself, using both non-GAAP and GAAP I get a pe ratio of either 15.60 or 16.0 and a peg that is much closer to Schwab than Fidelity.

Fidelity and Schwab have the exact same expected 3-5 expected EPS growth, so I'm just really confused and concerned, since I base my investment decisions on the data in these stock screeners.

Please, if anyone has any insight, let me know. I've been racking my brain all weekend trying to figure this out and I know if I reach out to Fidelity, Schwabb, etc. they're just going to refer me to their glossary page or whatever."

However, we recently had Keanu Reeves comment on his dislike for Facebook growing this industry, there is a huge chance that they're gonna be hit with antitrust in 2022 for the whistle-blower case, etc.. and people truly, blindly seem to hate Zuckerberg so much, many people will boycott their stuff and generally be anti-meta. The issue is that Facebook pioneered such a profound social institution, and one that became massively controversial later on. VR is poised to be potentially equally profound as social media.  As a result many people are now thinking ""ohhh not you fuckers, not this time!"" This line of thinking can easily extend to lawmakers.

Personally I think they will overcome negative sentiment with amazing and well priced products and innovations, but the road there may be rocky. Additionally I think while Facebook may have done some nasty shit before, they will have less incentive to try anything truly evil with the metaverse. I actually think they'll treat us just fine after all they've been through.

does the profit tesla makes from its current revenue represents the profit tesla will make from its future revenue?

if it doesnt, what will the profit margin be?

how important will self driving be for tesla's eventual market maturity?

can tesla use its self driving AI capabilities to profit in more ways then we see right now?

how impenetratable are tesla's current market advantages? can another technology company compete with them on their on turf further down the line?.

365,2022-01-02 22:24:51,"Smaller “boring” companies that are quietly crushing itIn One Up on Wall Street, Lynch suggests a strategy of scouting for smaller companies that do unexciting things very well and quietly expand their reach and profitability as a result. These companies tend to go unnoticed by most investors, but can reward avid scouts handsomely as the market catches on to their success.

What are your picks along these lines?

Mine are:

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) - regional sporting goods retailer; competitor to the likes of Dick’s. Headquartered in TX and expanding quickly though and US South and Southeast. Localized merchandising strategy, great pricing and selection, well run stores, always packed. Recently went public. Cheap at a ridiculous 6-7x earnings, even after a strong run up. Long prior track record as a successful private company. I no longer live near one, but wish I did.

Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS) - REIT focused on relatively nice retirement mobile home communities. Riding the boomer retirement wave and the growing need for affordable housing. Strong sustained FFO growth. 16% 10 year average dividend growth rate. Well run, consistent grower with clear tailwinds. Not exactly cheap, but not overpriced either.

What are your ideas along these lines? There must be a lot of profitable, growing and potentially undervalued small caps hiding on the fringes where most don’t look.

Edit: Thank you all for the wonderful suggestions. I haven’t looked through all of them yet, but I will, and suspect many of you will do the same. This will keep me busy for weeks!

366,2022-01-02 21:38:42,"Why HIMX is Just Getting StartedI’ve been getting a lot of DMs lately asking when I’m going to sell or responses to my posts asking how much more profit I think I can make or just saying no thanks I’ll wait for the next dip. I’m writing this post because this stock has already changed my life and I’d love if more of us could have that experience.

I’ve said multiple times that if Himx runs from its current price of 16 to 25 by august 2022 and Himx earnings stay flat for the next 3 quarters at 0.80 per share, which I highly doubt, it’s trailing pe at that time would be 7.8125. This is for a high growth fabless semiconductor tech company. In the end though I was using the 25$ price target because another Himx bull had thrown it out as a worst case number. Next let’s take two scenarios where we compare it to traditional established company estimates and then to a company that’s almost a mirror of Himx in its industry.

There is an old rule that established tech companies that are still growing well (not anywhere as fast as Himx though) should trade at a pe of 20 although I’d argue with all the retail money that has joined the markets in the past two years the new rule prob should be closer to 25 but let’s use 20 to be conservative. 

The last 4 earnings for Himx was 0.80, 0.62, 0.38, and 0.20 or $2.00 for the trailing twelve months. At 15.99 that puts current pe right at 8 but to trade at fair value for a slower growing tech company at a trailing pe of 20 then right now Himx should be at $40 share price and this is the conservative estimate 

The last 7 earnings for Himx have been 0.80, 0.62, 0.38, 0.20, 0.07, 0.01, 0.02. I show the last seven quarters because after they showed the 0.20 eps that quarter, the stock jumped to 16$, the same as it’s current price. Then the short position started growing like crazy and the stock tanked. Right before getting shorted when at a $16 share price it was trading at a trailing pe of 53.33 which is actually pretty appropriate in my opinion and according to industry comparisons. But more importantly look at the eps growth in the 3 quarters since then.

Marvell another fabless semiconductor company in my opinion is almost identical to Himax in moat, verticals, market share, growth etc. and makes for an almost perfect case study for Himx.

The last 4 quarters for Marvell have shown an eps of 0.43, 0.34, 0.29, 0.29. That’s a trailing twelve month earnings of $1.35. It closed at a price of 87.49. That puts its trailing pe at 64.81.

So if trailing pe was a mega conservative 20 like more established low growth tech then Himx should trade today at $40 (In august of 2022 with flat growth this should trade at $64 if trailing pe were 20). If it matched its growth pe, prior to the short attacks, of 53.33 then it would trade today at $106.66. Finally if it traded at a similar growth pe to its closest competitor in its industry that has similar albeit slower growth and similar dominant market share in its area of the semiconductor industry then it would trade today at $129.62.

This is why I’m not selling and why most of my original investment in HIMX is in Jan 2023 and Jan 2024 LEAPS. Even my expansion last week into this was still 70% shares and LEAPS.


Here is some of my original DD;
Himax is a fabless semiconductor company that specializes in display drivers. They currently have significant sales in phones, tablets, monitors, vr, televisions, and automotive. They are a technical leader in this field. In the last two weeks at a conference the ceo of continental hyped their relationship (continental is a supplier to almost every major tier 1 automaker in the world). As screens dominate modern cars and utilize more technology the number of display drivers needed per screen and number of screens per car (center console screen, hud, 2-4 screens for the hellions in the back) will rapidly increase. This is the highest margin vertical of Himx business and they are shifting production towards this sector. Also Himx secured long term supply chain contracts with foundries ensuring they will have access to a lot more silicon in 2022 allowing them to grow revenue and maintain technical dominance and market share in this fast growing sector. They already supply tier ones in Japan, south Korea, Europe and the USA. Their latest display driver has one of the most advanced local dimming features critical for high contrast conditions and yet it’s one of the lowest power options on the market. 

This semiconductor company has a 75%+ yoy growth like many companies during this time frame but this wasn’t during a downturn but a period of high growth. The key is their sequential or quarter over quarter revenue and earnings growth. They have posted 4 straight quarters of 15%+ qoq or sequential growth. Eps went from 0.62 to 0.80. Gross margin expanded from 47.5% to 51.7% sequentially. 

As of Monday it trades with a trailing pe of 6.14 and forward pe of 4.64. This is lower pe then other companies only growing 1% yoy.  Hell if their eps stayed flat for the next 3 quarters at 0.80 and the stock went from 15 to 25 then it’s trailing pe at that time would still only be 7.8125 

One of the chairmen with the most shares in the company recently announced he was buying another 10M worth of shares using his personal funds.

Now the short % is 14% of outstanding shares and 21% of float. This is an opportunity to buy a growing company with awesome fundamentals that could easily double by 2023 or even squeeze and double much sooner. 

Sorry for being so excited about this stock. I had a small position growing since October. In nov I tax loss harvested and doubled my position. I doubled my position again just last week. Friday I ended the day up 23.9k and was up 17k the day before that and there is still so much value left in this company. This has been life changing for me personally and I’m hoping more of you can see the value in Himx and also have a life changing experience. Hopefully we can all make some money together by following the fundamentals.

This is not financial advice and I have shares and 2023 and 2024 leaps.

Good luck and as always do your own dd."

368,2022-01-02 20:13:42,"Livent (LTHM) - discounted value play1) Lithium prices as a commodity are tracked based on sales in China, where the most lithium is imported and consumed

2) LTHM reported that [64% of its 2020 revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001742924/e66eb2e5-9298-4451-8a57-7f70109c7160.pdf) (page 9) came from China, making it the most relevant to the published spot prices (oh, and lithium prices at the end of 2021 were [up 486% over the end of 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium))

3) Since going public in 2018, the share price of LTHM has loosely remained on track with the spot price of lithium, but that has [changed drastically over the last two months](https://imgur.com/a/aoBsY81) \- This divergence is the crux of my point. 

4) The daily average lithium price in Q4 (203,555) was 84% higher than the Q3 daily average (110,612)

**My take**: when omicron broke out and the markets pulled back, lithium got lumped in with all the others that soared this year. However, the price of lithium never flinched. It declined exactly one day in all of 2021. LTHM's share price decrease of more than 25% from its ATH has no basis in fundamentals or future revenue. 

LTHM's next earnings call is likely going to be mid-late Feb. Since LTHM is a low-ish volume stock, I don't expect it to gap up immediately after earnings, but by the end of March it will return to ATH in the $35/share area. If the price of lithium continues to push upward between now and then, $40 is more in play. I'll be gradually adding OTM calls over the next 6 weeks.

First, how can one claim a year that saw an overall return of 17.3% a bear market is almost laughable.  Yes, we did see a sharp decline of 20%, but the market was recovered in exactly 181 days and hit 20 new highs by the end of the year; including one on December 31, 2020.  If this was a bear market, it was a cub at best.

Now, let's compare this to The Great Recession.  On October 9, 2007, we had hit an all-time high for the S&P 500.  We did not see a new high until 1997 days later on March 28, 2013.  That bear market lasted 11 times longer than the Pandemic Crash.

Now, let's compare this to the Tech Bubble.  On March 24, 2000, we had hit a new high and did not see another one until May 30, 2007.  That was a bear market that lasted a total of 2623 days; 14.5 times longer.  Of course, given that the market began to crash four months later, I often contend that the two periods together were one extended bear market.

Rocket Lab‘s launch site at the Wallops Flight Facility on the eastern coast of Virginia is expected to see a launch in 2022, as Rocket Lab and NASA near completion of a new flight safety certification system.

Launch Complex 2 will be the company’s first launch site in the United States. It was built specifically for the Electron rocket and is expected to support monthly orbital launches for both U.S. government and commercial missions. The complex has been finished since early 2020, when Rocket Lab rolled out an Electron vehicle on the pad, but there have been delays with the Autonomous Flight Termination System (AFTS) that will be used at the range.

According to NASA spokesperson Jeremy Eggers, NASA is working to certify the NASA-developed software for the NASA Autonomous Flight Termination Unit (NAFTU), which Rocket Lab intends to use for its flights from Wallops. Rocket Lab has been working with NASA on the unit in a development partnership.

There has been progress on the certification. On Dec. 17, NASA released to industry and Rocket Lab the most current version of the NAFTU software and documentation.

“We remain on track to complete flight safety certification of the software by the end of February 2022,” Eggers said. “Once that happens, Rocket Lab will need to process the software with their hardware and go through a safety review. In all, we expect to be able to support launch of the first Electron launch from Wallops in the second quarter of 2022.”

Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is ready to go at Wallops. “We could put a rocket on that pad and fly tomorrow,” Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, told Via Satellite. “NASA has had a number of delays in completing the [certification] process. So hopefully [in 2022], we’ll be able to see our vehicle on that pad and get customers lined up and start flying from there.”

When Rocket Lab chose Wallops over Cape Canaveral for its U.S. launch site in 2018, the company targeted an aggressive timeline, hoping to launch from Wallops in the third quarter of 2019. Rocket Lab has had to adjust its launch schedule during the wait. A U.S. Space Force/Air Force Research Lab mission launched in July had to be moved to the New Zealand Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 because of the delayed certification process. The launcher expects to complete an additional ten launches per year at the new Wallops launch pad.

The AFTS development partnership between Rocket Lab and NASA came about because of issues with launch processes during Rocket Lab’s first flight in May of 2018.

“Our very first flight was lost because of a simple ground software configuration on a traditional flight termination system,” Beck said. “After that flight, we said, ‘Nope, never again. We’re not having all of these guys on buttons, and making mistakes and whatnot. We’re going to do it all with a computer, and we’re going to do it autonomously.’ We worked with NASA who had an autonomous system in development, and we actually started flying it with them a year ago. We used the Autonomous Flight Termination System to fly out of the New Zealand range on a standard basis.”

NASA is now hoping to get all U.S. launches converted over from manual flight termination operations to autonomous flight termination. NASA isn’t the main driver to convert to AFTS, Eggers said, but is more of a whole-of-industry initiative.

“The NAFTU is a game-changing command and control system for small launch vehicle providers for use at all U.S. launch ranges in ensuring public safety during launch operations. The system provides a number of benefits, such as wider launch windows, smaller downrange safety corridors that enhance area clearance operations, and reduced need/expense of ground-based systems.”

“The autonomous system that we worked with NASA on is a NASA product, and it’s NASA software,” Beck said. “They are certifying their own software to enable their own box of electronics and software to be used on any launch vehicle in any range in America. At the end of the day, what they’re trying to create, and what we’re partnered with them to create, is a box of electronics that every launch vehicle can bolt on and use on any U.S. range.”

When NASA finishes all their software updates and certifies the software, Beck says, all of the pain of a flight termination system will be evaporated for other launch providers.

“Providers can just go and buy the box from NASA, put it on their rocket and fly without all of the people in the traditional flight termination system,” he says. “As we see all these new rocket motors come into the market, they will all fly the system that Rocket Lab has so painstakingly developed alongside a government partner. It is amazing to the industry.”"

385,2022-01-02 14:28:33,"Student loans will NOT cause the next crashAfter writing my old post (Link:[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rtdpr6/student\_loans\_might\_cause\_the\_next\_crash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rtdpr6/student_loans_might_cause_the_next_crash/)) I have done some more research and come to the conclusion that student debt loans are way to insignificant to the market to actively cause crash. 

TL;DR Student loans wont cause a crash. SLABS dont have a market big enough, the principal amount of debt is too small.

Number 1: The market for SLABS (Student Loan Asset-Backed Securities) is too small to have a say in the stock market. SLABS make up for 340 billion USD of the ABS market which may sound a lot but its really just less than 1% of the fixed income market. 

Picture: [https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/getattachment/Perspectives/portfolio-strategy/asset-backed-securities-abs/Non-Mortgage-ABS-Place-in-the-Structured-Finance-Universe.png.aspx](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/getattachment/Perspectives/portfolio-strategy/asset-backed-securities-abs/Non-Mortgage-ABS-Place-in-the-Structured-Finance-Universe.png.aspx)

So imagine an extra link under the Non mortgage ABS with student loans of 340b. 

Number 2: The total amount of debt is too small. Americans owe Ca. 1.7 trillion USD of debt. While this may sound a lot its nothing compared to the 14.7 trillion mortgage debt owed in 2008 or even the 17 trillion mortgage debt owed today."

* How old are you?
* When will you need the money?
* Will you consider Hedge Funds?
* Will you consider REITs?
* Will you consider Commodities?
* Will you consider International Investing?
* What is the value of your investment portfolio?
* How much do you save a year?
* What percent of your savings is in tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s, or 403(b)s?
* How many people, such as a child, spouse, or aging parent, are financially dependent on you?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 3 years?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 10 years?
* How much equity do you have in your home, or do you rent?
* What is your marginal federal tax rate?
* How much volatility can you live with?
* What is the reading over the U.S. economy over the next 12 months?

Assuming that one has a young 22-year old, fresh out of college who rents, and has no investible assets. Retirement is a long time away. I came up with this as an example:

* Cash 1%
* Cash Equivalents 7.3%
* Bonds 2.8%
* Large Cap 21.8%
* Mid Cap 18.4%
* Small-Cap 15.0%
* Developed Markets 6.8%
* Emerging Markets 4.5%
* Real Estate 3.7%
* Commodities 3.7%
* Hedging Strategies 15.0%

388,2022-01-02 11:52:24,"Should I invest my student loans into index funds?As per title, I am wondering what you all think of this.

To give you some context. I am NOT talking about an American student loan but an European loan:

1. The interest rate will be 0,01%. Nowhere near the insane predatory rates of my American counterparts.
2. We are talking about max € 20k in loans i.e ~ 1000 euro loan per month for 2 years.
3. I will only have to start paying back monthly payment two years after I stop lending or graduation. Therefore, I would be 4 years in the stock market before I even have to start paying back. 
4. The inflation at my current country is 5,4% i.e. the inflation alone will eat away my debt.
5) The monthly payments could be between 90-250 euros
6) I already have ~20k debt in student loans
7) I could always pay it back if I really have too. Only way I could get fucked is if the market will crash and I am “stuck” with selling for a loss which I won’t do anyways.

390,2022-01-02 09:24:19,"Cash is a position - and a bad oneMy person: I am 59 years of age and bought my first security 40 years ago.

I keep reading that cash is a good thing to hold in case the market breaks. Bonds (except maybe Junk Bonds) are basically the same as cash when looking at inflation.

I write this article because it seems that 95% of investors have another opinion, I am a contrarian here.

Cash is a position; and a dangerous one. The main problem is of course that security investments are always compared to cash, even measured in cash. But cash can be more volatile than securities. Cash may be created by central banks, by banks and even by every person just writing a debt on a piece of paper. But this is not the subject of this post.

Everybody needs cash, it is so practical. Without it you would need to exchange goods for goods, which could be a pain in the ass. True. Money has two purposes: facilitate exchange of goods and keep values. Now, money is not very good at keeping value. So the best you can do with it is exchange it for goods.

Sometimes you may read something like ""a lot of our money is debt"". That is true, even worse, all of our money is debt. And it is almost guaranteed to lose value.

So what can we do? I cannot speak for other people, but I can describe what I do: As money is debt, somebody owes me. So I try to create debt for myself to balance that out. I usually take a margin loan with my broker for every cent I have in my purse or in my bank accounts. That debt is covered by dividend stocks that at the moment pay more dividends then I have to pay interest.

Now the second argument that one hears in favour of cash: the market may crash and you can use it to buy stocks then. That is a valued argument, but what happens during the time you have to wait for such an event to occur? You lose double, money decreases in value and you lose the opportunity to gain money in other investments.

So what do I do? I am always invested 100%. When the market dips 20% or more I wait for signs of recovery, than buy on margin, if possible stocks that pay more dividends than I have to pay interest. Then I pay down the debt with the dividends and some partial sales when the market reaches a top again.

In my early days as an investor there was a saying ""divide your investments: your age in bonds, the rest in stocks"". I don't like that, liquid stocks are easier to cash-in then bonds. And bonds are almost guaranteed to lose money now.

Hope I could give some of you a different perspective.

Wish you all a happy and successful new year!"
391,2022-01-02 08:51:20,"CATL vs. LG Chem and Samsung SDII'm looking at the performance of the EV battery makers and it appears that the market views Chinese CATL much more favorably compared to their Korean counter parts.

CATL ([300750.SZ](https://300750.SZ)) forward P/E = 90

LG Chem (051910.KS) forward P/E = 20

Samsung SDI (006400.KS) forward P/E = 34

There are some differences, as CATL has a slightly bigger market share, but it is very close to LG Chem (Samsung SDI is much smaller, but still pretty big). LG Chem has other businesses too, but I think they're are rather minor compared to the EV batteries and Samsung SDI is only the battery business.

Anyway, not exactly apples-to-apples, but the market clearly thinks CATLK is the winner. What am I missing about them? What non-obvious advantages CATL have compared to all of their competitors?

Update: as I keep researching the topic, one factor may be that CATL use a ""less advanced"" but apparently cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) as opposed to ""more advanced"" batteries produced by Samsung and LG."

395,2022-01-02 03:37:40,"When to sell stocksI guess I should preface my question with my style of investing.  When choosing what stocks to buy, basically there's one thing I look at: fundamentals.  Not accounting fundamentals, technological, business, leadership, etc.  Ideally I would only buy stocks for products I actually like, but the nature of trading is: any stocks you buy will require a lot of unknowns and abstractions.  I can't speak to the CEO on the phone, or inspect a factory/lab/patent/whatever.

Once I buy a stock, I just sort of buy it and forget about it.  I don't track day-to-day prices.  The only thing I care about is: Have the reasons for my buying the stock changed.  If so, I sell, if not I wait... and wait... and wait..

So that gets to my question: when should I sell?  I'm currently long on three stocks:
TMUS, TMRC, RYCEY

TMUS: I bought this because they've invested heavily into mobile internet, and have broad (useful!) 5G coverage.  They're also quickly utilizing their bandwidth by offering services such as: TV, internet, etc.  I expect a lot of growth in this sector.

TMRC: wanted to invest in lithium, looked at the information they put out: their reasons to invest, their reasons why they're good, bought them and they've performed excellently.

RYCEY: Rolls-Royce is a company the UK will likely not let go bankrupt.  They tumbled with Coronavirus, but that shouldn't change their business model at all.  They're also huge into military jets, and war feels ever-present on the horizon.

so I'm pretty clear on when/how I buy, but what are some rules/guidelines for when to sell?  I don't have any.  When do you sell?  When is it wise to sell (risk/reward)?"

I read the IRS rules and thought I could contribute to a traditional IRA and get to deduct the contribution on this year's taxes. Below is from the IRS website. We file jointly and our joint MAGI is over $125k but less than $198k. I contribute to a 401k, but my spouse does not (yet), and therefore I thought we would be allowed to deduct the contribution from our taxes based on the second item listed below, but after further reading more in this sub and other sites, I'm not certain I read it correctly and may not be allowed the credit as I think the IRA would need to be my spouses name? 

Here are the traditional IRA phase-out ranges for 2021:
$105,000 to $125,000 – Married couples filing jointly. This applies when the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan.
$198,000 to $208,000 – A taxpayer not covered by a workplace retirement plan married to someone who's covered.

Also, I now wonder if a Roth might have been a better option even if we did get the credit as you don't pay tax on withdrawals. 
I opened a traditional IRA a few days ago on 12/30 and started the fund transfer as I thought I needed to do it before the end of the year. I opened a traditional IRA through my Webull account as that is what I use for trading stocks, and thought it would be easier since all my banking info is already linked and it would be easy to manage the account. Probably a mistake. The funds are not fully transferred to the IRA yet. Can I transfer the funds back to my bank, delete the traditional IRA account, and then open a Roth IRA? Or will I get a penalty for that?

I had the privilege of having grandparents who looked out for me and setup these accounts 10+ years ago. Over the years my portfolio has grown overall, but recently I’ve been educating myself on stocks/investing and I think there is definitely lots of room for improvement.

I am now 32 and I’m in the process of setting up my own portfolio made up of index funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, Roth IRA, and 401k (I did not include these accounts in the Imgur album but it’s a mix of FZROX/VTSAX/VOO in my retirement accounts + VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV in my taxable account). However I’d still like to maintain a stock portfolio in my Schwab account to play around with. With about $500k in assets, I’m thinking of allocating approximately $400k (80%) to index funds and $100k (20%) to individual stocks. I have $20k in I-bonds as well but I’m still undecided on whether to include more bonds as part of my portfolio at this time. I’d rather focus on growth/accumulation at this time and potentially set myself up for early retirement. 

With all that in mind, which equities do you think I should keep and which should I sell? For starters, I think I’d like to sell all the mutual funds that my grandparents chose and instead put it into VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV which have better historical and expected returns (keeping a 20% SCV tilt with AVUV/AVDV). As far as individual stocks, there are several blue chip stocks that have done really well like PG, DIS, CAT, POST, and PEP, but I’m wondering if I should sell high along with some that have stagnated like XOM, INTC, BA, C, and GE to name a few. 

Basically I’d like to totally revamp my portfolio and invest in stocks that I believe in rather than what was chosen for me years ago. Also since my index fund allocation already gives me plenty of exposure to U.S. large cap, I’m wondering if it’s worthwhile to invest additional funds in FAANG + MSFT or should I focus on high risk/high reward value stocks instead with the “play money” I have. Any advice and input is much appreciated!

Edit: [Here is a list of stocks I have on my watchlist](https://imgur.com/a/ZGcAQmv/) that I’d like to potentially invest in after selling some of the equities I’m currently holding.

For someone who is looking to actively trade, would it make sense to hold the investment amount in these no expense ratio mutual funds? Holding the investable amount as cash in the brokerage account seems like a bad idea since it loses value due to inflation. Instead, investing in a zero expense index mutual fund would allow it to grow in the market, but also provide one the opportunity to sell the required amount to fund stock buying opportunities at a target value.

A breakdown of the process -

1. Invest $25,000 in FZILX and leave it to market forces.
2. 3 months from then, Musk tweets something stupid and causes TSLA to drop 15% in 1 week.
3. Since you believe TSLA is now at a lower price than what it actually needs to be, you sell $2000 worth of FZILX and invest in TSLA instead.

Is this a sound strategy? What are the drawbacks, if any, instead of holding that amount as cash in the brokerage account? I understand that the market can go down causing the fund value to drop."

415,2022-01-01 18:07:27,"Calculating ReturnSo we all know you calculate return by (final - initial) / initial but this becomes weird when you deposit new funds towards the end of the calculation period. Like take an extreme example: you start the year with $10k and double it to $20k end of year for a 100% return. Now let’s say last day of the year you deposit $20k. Now your return would calculate as 10/30, 33% return for the year. I have seen brokers handle this differently too, like Robinhood would handle that as 33%, but then I have seen others like Webull handle it different which I do not understand. What would be the appropriate way to calculate taking deposits into account?"

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and year, and are ready for the new trading week/year ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 3rd, 2022.

# **Stocks could ride the 2021 tailwind into the new year, but the jobs report and Fed will be in focus - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/31/stocks-could-ride-the-2021-tailwind-into-the-new-year-but-the-jobs-report-and-fed-will-in-focus.html)**
*****
> It’s back to business in the week ahead with a busy economic calendar to start the new year, including the always important monthly jobs report.
*****
> After a stellar 2021, stocks head into the 2022 with a tailwind, but the course of the market in the new year will depend more on solid earnings growth and a strong economy than a super easy Federal Reserve.
*****
> The S&P 500 rose 27% to 4,766 in a banner year, notching 70 record closing highs. The benchmark outpaced the 19% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 21% rise in the Nasdaq Composite.
*****
> With Monday’s opening bell, the clock starts ticking on a quarter that could see the first Fed rate hike since 2018. In the bond market, worries about the latest omicron Covid-19 variant could give way to an investment community more intent on a reset of expectations for where interest rates are heading over the course of 2022.
*****
> The employment report is the most important data on a calendar that also includes the ISM manufacturing survey data and auto sales, both slated for Tuesday. International trade data is released Thursday.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, economists expect 405,000 jobs were added in the final month of 2021, up from 210,000 in November. The unemployment rate is expected to slide to 4.1% from 4.2%.
*****
> “It’s the start of a new year. History would tell you we should kick it off in a pretty strong way, especially considering we’ve seen this kind of rolling correction,” said Sameer Samana, senior global equities strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We appreciate the fact the S&P has been making new highs, but when you look at the average stock or small cap stocks, they’ve had a very different experience.”
*****
> The 2021 market was bifurcated with an initial surge in some high flying growth stocks, but then many of those names fell hard, and some of the big-cap names in the S&P 500 turned in super-charged performances.
*****
> Microsoft was up 51% for the year, while Apple gained 34%. Home Depot was up 56%, and American Express gained 35%. Ford was up 136%.
*****
> The ARK Innovation ETF, a high flying collection of growth stocks in 2020, was down 24% for the year.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> On Wednesday, the Fed will release minutes from its December meeting. Following that meeting, the central bank announced it would speed up the tapering of its once $120 billion a month bond buying program — now ending it by March instead of June. The March meeting is now viewed as the first opportunity for the Fed to move on a rate hike. The Fed has forecast three for 2022.
*****
> “I think next week people start to shift to this changing monetary landscape. It’s such a big deal,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “The liquidity flows over the past two years has been nothing we’ve ever seen before.”
*****
> Strategists expect 2022 to be choppier for the stock market, as the Fed ends its bond purchases and moves to raise interest rates from zero. Stock strategists have a median target of 5,050 for the S&P 500, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.
*****
> Boockvar said the impact of tightening policy will be felt globally, as other central banks also reduce their asset purchase programs and move toward raising interest rates.
*****
> “That liquidity flow is slowing down, and we know how much of a help it’s been,” Boockvar said. “You can’t separate a Fed tightening cycle from the stock market. You can’t separate the market. They’re all connected. There’s no such thing that you can avoid the tightening of financial conditions.”
*****
> Wells’ Samana said he is focused on quality in big-cap U.S. stocks for the new year. “You’ve got to take what the market gives you and what it’s giving you now is there’s not a lot of reasons to step away from U.S. large cap,” he said. “We like tech, we like communications services. We like financials, and we like industrials. Two growth sectors and two cyclical sectors. We’ve been boiling it down to anything but defensives.”
*****
> Samana said Wells strategists downgraded the materials and energy sectors. At the same time, they upgraded tech. “We want to have a much more balanced position going into 2022, we just don’t know what opportunities will present themselves.”
*****
> Energy was the top performer of the major sectors in 2021, up 48%, its best increase ever. It was followed by real estate, which jumped 42%. Technology was up 33%, and financials also gained 33%.
*****
> Matt Maley of Miller Tabak pointed out the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has outperformed tech and semiconductors in December. The fund was up nearly 10%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund gained 3% for the month.
*****
> “In other words, that action in the stock market over the past several weeks has been a lot different than it has seemed to a lot of people. We have not seen a melt-up … and the tech stocks have not done as well as most people think,” Maley wrote in a note. “More importantly, one of the most defensive groups in the marketplace has been the one that has been rallying nicely. In our opinion, this tells us that investors are quite worried about the effect that the Fed’s new (more aggressive) tightening cycle could have on the stock market next year.”
*****
> # What else to watch
> The actions of OPEC+ have been an important factor driving oil prices and oil stocks this past year. West Texas Intermediate futures were up about 55% in 2021.
*****
> OPEC+ meets Tuesday and is expected to continue its policy of slowly returning oil to the market.

> # Dogs of the Dow End of 2021 Update

> The Dogs of the Dow is a very simple and passive strategy with the basic concept being to buy the ten highest yielders of the Dow 30 at year's end and repeating the process annually. In 2021, the only Dog of the Dow that did not finish the year higher was Verizon (VZ) which shed 7.53% on a total return basis. On average across these names, the strategy would have returned 16.3%. That compares to a 20.69% return for the rest of the index. As we close out 2021, the only change to the Dogs of 2021 for next year is that Cisco (CSCO) which now yields 2.33% will drop out and be replaced by Intel (INTC) with its yield of 2.70%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/123121-f.png))**

> In the chart below, we show the cumulative total return of this strategy versus holding the entirety of the Dow going back over the past twenty years. Historically, the Dogs have tended to outperform the broader index, but since the pandemic hit, that has not been the case. Not only have the non-dogs been outpacing the highest yielding stocks in the index, but the dogs of the Dow have yet to break out (though they are getting close after the past few day's rally) from the range that has been in place since early June.

> # Small Caps vs Large Cap Spread When Yields Change

> The recent underperformance of small caps has been partially attributed to rising current yields and assumed rate hikes in 2022. However, small caps have not historically always declined during periods when treasury yields have been on the rise. In fact, since 2000, the S&P 600 Small Cap Index has tended to outperform the S&P 500 during years when the 10-year yield rose. The first table below shows years when the 10-year yield increased, and for each year we also show the performance of the small-cap S&P 600 and the large-cap S&P 500. In the nine prior years where the 10-year yield increased, the S&P 600 outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 6.0 percentage points (ppts) and a median of 3.6 over the course of the year with outperformance 70% of the time.

> In the second table, we show years where the 10-year yield declined, and in those years small caps still outperformed but by a more modest 2.4 ppts (median: 0.2 ppts). This goes to show that not all small caps are negatively impacted by rates, but it is worth noting that the names in the S&P 600 tend to have positive earnings whereas the Russell 2000 has a larger number of unprofitable companies. The Fed has signaled multiple rate hikes in 2022, but based on historical trends it should not necessarily be interpreted as a negative headwind for small-cap stocks with positive earnings.

> The worst year since 2000 for small caps relative to large caps was in 2019 when the group underperformed by 8.3 percentage points and in 2019, rates declined by 70 basis points. The best year for small caps on a relative basis was in 2000 when the 10-year yield dropped 148 bps and the S&P 600 outperformed the S&P 500 by 22.3 ppts.

> # Breadth Disconnects

> As we mentioned in today's Sector Snapshot and yesterday's Chart of the Day, breadth for the S&P 500 has ripped higher recently. In the charts below, we show the price and cumulative advance/decline (AD) lines for each of the eleven sectors and the S&P 500. The cumulative advance/decline line measures the daily number of advancers minus decliners within a sector or index over a given time frame. Bulls want to see this reading make new highs when the index or sector's price makes new highs. Right now, every sector but Communication Services and Energy is seeing new highs in the cumulative AD line. Three sectors have seen their cumulative AD line make new highs this week even though the index's price has not yet made a new high -- Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Industrials. That's a hugely positive divergence.

> # Charts of the Year

> There are so many charts and tables that sum up how special 2021 was, but at the end of the day the fact that 2021 had the second most all-time highs ever probably tells the story better than nearly any other.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-1.jpg))**

> Not to be outdone, this year will go down as one of the best ever for the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-2.png))**

> Many would consider 2021 to be a volatile year for stocks, but the S&P 500 Index only had one 5% pullback all year and that was during the Evergrande worries in September/October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-3.png))**

> Here’s putting the 5.2% peak to trough pullback in perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-4.png))**

> This was the fasted bull market to ever double and it set the record by a wide margin.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-5.jpg))**

> Every single month made a new all-time high (12 for 12), matching 2014 as the only years to accomplish this incredible feat.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-6.jpg))**

> Were there signs the bull market would be this strong? “Although many were caught flatfooted by the strong equity returns this year, there were numerous clues,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The huge end of year rally in 2020 was the first clue. Add in a strong first five days, a strong first quarter, the S&P 500 holding above the December lows in the first quarter, and right there you had several signals early in the year that strong returns were quite possible in 2021.”

> Let’s get to some of the charts and tables we shared earlier this year that signaled the possibility of big returns in 2021.

> The huge end of year rally was a good sign for 2020, as when the final two months gain more than 10% (like 2020), then the following year has never been lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-7.png))**

> The strong first five days suggested much higher than average returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-8.png))**

> When stocks were up more than 4% year to date by Valentine’s Day, the rest of the year tended to do well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-9.png))**

> The big first quarter for stocks said better times were ahead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-10.png))**

> The December Indicator was another big clue 2021 would be special. This indicator signals potential for a strong year when the first quarter low doesn’t violate the December low, like we saw this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-11.png))**

> A strong first 100 days of the year for stocks boded well for the rest of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-Chart-12.png))**

> The S&P 500 had a 7-month win streak end in September, but the returns after such long win streaks only added to the bulls’ resume.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-13.png))**

> Things looked good for a strong fourth quarter, as the S&P 500 was up 6 quarters in a row heading into it, which historically was good for the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-Chart-14.png))**

> After a negative November when stocks are up more than 20% for the year, the usually bullish December actually does better. Well, stocks are up close to 5% this final month of the year, so this played out nicely yet again.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-Chart-15.jpg))**

> Those were all clues 2021 was going to be strong. Now let’s look at charts and tables we’d classify as interesting.

> The Dow hit six 1,000 point milestones in 2021, the most for any one year ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-16.png))**

> We’ve heard a lot about how higher rates were bad for stocks, but history says that simply isn’t true.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-17.png))**

> Turns out, the first rate hike isn’t all that bad either. We haven’t even seen the first rate hike yet, but it is coming, so don’t get overly worried just yet.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-18.png))**

> Taking things a step further, stocks have historically done great the year before the first hike in a cycle, gaining the past nine cycles by an average of 15% heading into that first hike. Not so scary at all.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-19.png))**

> Stocks did great under President Biden, with his first 100 days in office ranking as one of the best ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-20.png))**

> What about 2022? Here are some charts and tables that suggest this bull market still has time left.

> The big gains this year may be a good sign for 2022, as the past nine times the S&P 500 was up at least 20% it was higher the following year. Not to mention, the following year has been up 11.5% on average, a better than average return. Remember that 11.5% number….

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-21.png))**

> Mid-cycle years are higher 80% of the time and up an average of 11.5%. Stocks may not gain 20% next year, but we may still see a solid return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-Chart-22.png))**

> Now let’s end with some fun. These are signals that we would never suggest investing in, but they all indeed have turned out to be correct.

> Turns out Zodiac signs can be worth watching, as the year of the Ox has been strong for stocks. This sure played out in 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-23.png))**

> Don’t ever invest in this, but the Super Bowl Indicator suggested the Bucs winning was a good sign, as NFC wins have meant better stock returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-24.png))**

> Tom Brady in the Super Bowl hasn’t always been good for stocks, but when he wins, they do better. The Bucs winning didn’t hurt things.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.29.21-Blog-chart-25.png))**

418,2022-01-01 17:29:56,"Since 1/1/2020, an allocation of 90% S&P 500 and 10% TSLA has outperformed ARKKI was wondering how much ARKK's performance is due to TSLA, so I back tested a portfolio 90% SPY 10% TSLA against 100% ARKK (which is 10% TSLA). I chose 1/1/2020 as the starting date because I believe most investors probably had never heard of ARKK before 2020 and therefore would not have been invested.

If you had invested $10,000 into SPY/TSLA, you'd have $24,976 today.

If you had invested $10,000 into ARKK, you'd have $19,370.

(Yes, I realize that SPY does contain a bit of TSLA so in actuality the first portfolio has like 11-12% TSLA. But it doesn't really change the overall result)

Edit: I did the same analysis using different starting years. The SPY/TSLA portfolio still wins out if you start with 1/1/2019 or 1/1/2018. You have to start all the way back in 2017 for ARKK to come out ahead."

That was two days after MU issued guidance that everything was going good with their business. MU went on to have a great earnings report just a couple weeks ago and analysts went on to upgrade the stock.

A possible future one is TGT. It got downgraded because there were rumors there was less foot traffic at retail stores. Well outside sources have since reported holidays sales increased. If this shows up in the earnings report. Analysts may end up upgrading TGT. Others may be all the rerating of growth stocks that happened right after many of them fell off cliff around November 9-10."

428,2022-01-01 09:27:53,"Irish person wanting to find a broker to process buy/sell trades for TSX-V or OTC stockHello,

Edit: I just realised I shouldn't post this here. So sorry. Is this a violation or is the question itself ok to ask? Please remove if a problem. 

&#x200B;

I work for a company traded on the Canadian TSX-V  and  the USA OTC markets. But I live in Ireland. I have some options that have vested and I want to exercise those options and either immediately sell them or sell to cover the cost of buying them. If I don't sell all of them immediately, I will want to sell all of them within the next 6 months. I have questions...

1. I need to find a broker to do this for me.  I think finding a local broker who can buy these for me is not easy. And I am nervous of using, say, a US or Canadian broker. I imagine there are regulations around who can sell what to whom. I want to keep the associated costs of doing the transaction down. So avoiding an annual fee.
2. I'd prefer if they could cover the cost of buying rather than me having to pay. And I am trying to understand if a calculation of the exercise and sell to cover would include the tax liability or is that a separate thing or can I tell them what I think the tax will be and ask them to sell enough to cover the purchase price, plus taxes, plus commissions/fees?
3. Am I right in thinking that if I expect the price to go up in the near term, then the best thing is to exercise the options, pay the income tax now on the current price (which is >40%) and then I'll only be hit for capital gains tax (33%) if I sell later and the price has gone up?

My thanks in advance,

TheFullIrish"
429,2022-01-01 07:28:25,"Watch out for Hyped Junk Stocks in 2022Hyped up stocks ruined a lot of investors in 2021 and will continue doing so in the future. I was looking at how Nikola was doing right now, and it is trading at a valuation of fucking $4B dollars. An overhyped, almost borderline fraud company, with less than $100K revenue and not a single vehicle delivered is trading at such absurd valuation. You know what's even more crazy. In June 2020, Nikola traded at a valuation of $25B, a market cap equal to quarter market cap of gargantuan organization like Citibank that had a revenue of $70B. A $25B valuation with no sales and no revenue to show for it. Just goes to show how much people will fall into these hype traps. Eventually, Nikola crashed but still it is massively overvalued. Nikola is just one example and there are hundreds if not thousands of such stocks.

Invest in cashflow rich companies with steady growth and good margins and you will never go wrong. Think AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSM, COST, V, to name a few. Do your own DD and think of buying a stock as buying a piece of that company for the long haul. One of my favourite quotes from Warren Buffett is that ""When you buy a stock, think that if the stock market were to close down for a decade, would I be happy with owning this business? If the answer is resounding yes for you, then only you should buy it."" 

Good luck stock picking and Happy new year!"
430,2022-01-01 06:50:37,"Student loans might cause the next crashI have changed my opinon on this post and have made a [new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ruaoux/student_loans_will_not_cause_the_next_crash/)

TL;DR: Student loans are getting out of control and the average American is struggling to pay back. Once Biden's student loan pause stops the debt market might spiral out of control.

Okay ill make my thesis pretty clear from the start:Americans aren't able to pay their student loans back.

A pretty simple thesis right? In my opinion, yes, it's a lot simpler than mortgages.

The subprime mortgage crash of 2008 was caused by, in short terms, people not being able to afford paying their mortgages after their teaser rates expired.Theres a myriad of other ways to explain it and  thats just what I think. People were getting loans they obviously couldn't pay.They ignored the rates in the long term because they were being blinded with the misconceptions that they could always refinance their terms. This was obviously wrong, but the issuers didn't give a shit, because it made them rich. So they kept on dishing out loans to people even with shitty credit scores.

This time however Americas debt problems have taken a different turn. The student loan market is very different from the mortgage market. Obviously the market is smaller, but student loans are still the second largest consumer debt with a market of 1.6 trillion USD. The crazy thing is that the average debt incurred by students to fund their seminary education is $33,000. While the student loans cause less debt than mortgages they also often have worse terms. Issuers tend to focus on the principal amount owed while ignoring the interest that accumulates. This can really mess some people up when  in their later years of college they realise that they might need to take an extra semester to pass. Student debt can also set a stopper on getting a mortgage. If you spend say 10 or 15% on your student debt, getting a mortgage where you pay say 35% can be impossible. Student debt is also harder to refinance as fewer private issuers include refinancing in their terms, and with federal loans it forfeits key consumer protections.If you go bankrupt you cant discharge your loan without proving that your issuer is causing you ""undue hardship"". In mortgages all of these things are much easier to do and the debt market is obviously much more regulated.

So far I have only talked about how student loans are rigged against the average American. However one of the most pressing issues are the unjust rising costs of college. Ill let this chart speak for itself: [https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg](https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg)

Biden recently extended the Student debt forgiveness act. This is obviously bearish. This can be compared to the teaser rates running out and people not being able to afford their payments. As people haven't had to pay student loans in a while now, it is fair to say the part of their income that went to student debt has gone to other things. Maybe restaurants, maybe a new car with more debt etc... This basically means that people are going to be struggling to find money to repay their loans with.

So, how can we profit off of this? I would say credit default swaps. However i dont really know the credit derivatives market well and maybe someone in the comments has a better idea?

I dont really know how this is going to play out on the markets. But its going to be interesting.

TL;DR at the top."

436,2022-01-01 00:34:34,"Stock Account to cover Subscriptions + InflationThis may sound stupid and irrational, but I want to set up an account to cover the cost of all my subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify etc.) while considering the cost of inflation (i.e. the subscription cost increase). 

I think a helpful starting place is the [4% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp). So let's say I have 400$ worth of subscriptions. I would invest 10 000$ in an account to cover the cost of subscriptions.

Characteristic of the trading account:
- Should have a constant book value over time. I.e. if I put in 10K, after 20 years, after covering for the pre-determined amount of subscriptions, it should still have 10k.
- Should account for inflation for subscriptions (~2%/year). I.e. I would take out 2% more money from the account every year because the subscription could go up by that much.

What's the best way to set this up? What kind of stock/assets should I be buying? High dividend yield or high growth? I'm considering just buying S&P 500 ETF and taking 5%/year since the S&P 500 has an average return of 10% (I know past performance is not an indicator of the future lol...). Should I take out the money if I find myself affording the subscriptions to let ""compounding do its thing""?

P.S. I'm doing this because I kind of hate subscriptions, and I am averse to them, but sometimes they can be indispensable and save you tons of time. But I have an irrational fear of them lol. So if I can invest more money in the process to justify spending a bit of money, then WIN-WIN?"

445,2021-12-31 19:16:04,"A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this yearOver the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. 

I am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) 

Despite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. 

Meanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. 

But, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. 

There are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. 

I have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. 

One last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody ""buying the haystack"" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. 

In summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots."

It’s great if a company is doing 30-40%+ top line yoy, but there are many of those out there and most have it in common that they’re burning a ton of money for that growth and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. I hold those too, but find it harder to pinpoint companies managing their growth cycle positive or at least near break even.

So I ask, where are you looking for and finding profitable or break even companies growing revenue at least 20%+ over the next few years? No specific sector in mind.

Personally some of my more recent entries with this in mind, and their recent weakness, are PGNY, ESMT,  UPST, APPS, & COCO (which admittedly will likely will fall short of 20%+). Missed NARI on the pullback, but still eyeing it as well."

&#x200B;

The US stock market is driven by institutional investors b/c they own the money.

&#x200B;

The opposite is true in China, where 80% of the Chinese stock market is driven by retail investors.

&#x200B;

This means it's very hard for US hedge funds to find alpha in the US market (ie smart money is competing against other smart money).

&#x200B;

However, it is much easier for US hedge funds to find alpha in the Chinese market b/c they're competing against retail investors, not smart money.

&#x200B;

This is why Chinese stocks can very quickly go up 10X, the stock price is driven by retail investors (retail investors are more likely to be driven by emotion and not research).

&#x200B;

If you own a Chinese stock, focus on the underlying business and don't be persuaded to sell/buy a stock because of daily price fluctuations. It could very well be a long/short fund manipulating the price to take advantage of investors.

Now I see a ""Wash Sale"" tag on my Fidelity account next to a few of the orders in Purchase History section—not all of them, interestingly. 

I was under the impression Wash Sale would not be triggered by selling VXUS and buying IXUS, which trades on a different index and holds a different amount of stocks in the ETF. 

Anyone know why this happened? Am I screwed? 

The disclaimer at the bottom of the page for wash sale says:

*""Adjusted due to previous wash sale disallowed loss. If you sell shares at a loss and you purchase additional shares of the same or a substantially identical security (in the same or a different account) within the 61 day period that begins 30 days before and ends 30 days after the sale, the purchase may result in a wash sale. If a wash sale occurs, the loss from the transaction should be ""disallowed"" for tax purposes, and the amount of the loss should be added to the cost basis of the newly-purchased shares. Unless otherwise requested or noted, Fidelity adjusts cost basis information related to newly-purchased shares when a wash sale occurs within an account as the result of an identical security purchase. Fidelity does not report disallowed losses or adjust cost basis information related to wash sales triggered by sales and purchases of the same security within different accounts or by sales and purchases of substantially identical securities within the same or different accounts. Fidelity does not apply any wash sale rules to tax lots with customer or 3rd-party provided cost basis.

Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 185,000 F-150 pickup trucks over an issue with the vehicle's driveshaft that could increase the risk of a crash, according to documents filed with federal safety regulators this month.


The recall of some 184,698 units from model years 2021 and 2022 that may be affected is due to an issue in which ""underbody heat and noise insulators may loosen and contact the aluminum driveshaft, which could damage the driveshaft and cause it to fracture,"" according to the safety recall. Ford notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the recall Dec. 16.


A fractured driveshaft could cause the loss of drive power, or the loss of vehicle control if the driveshaft comes into contact with the ground, according to the recall notice. ""Additionally, unintended movement could occur while parked if the parking brake is not engaged. Any of these scenarios can increase the risk of a crash.""

As of Dec. 7, there had been 27 reports of fractured aluminum driveshafts, according to Ford. The Dearborn automaker says it is not aware of any injuries or crashes related to the issue."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

469,2021-12-31 09:37:53,"Tax wash sales. Holding a small position after day trading months ago, can't sell the remaining options!I traded a stock over 30 times at the beginning of the year and I ended up holding a $5,000 call position that is now entirely worthless. However, i am unable to sell this final position because there is no buyers and it expires next month in January. Which means it will carry forward into next year and likely expire worthless as a -$5,000 loss

I read through this last year and i heard that it is based on a ""tax lot"" 

Does this mean since i haven't purchased any investments in this company for 6 months now, that all the other gains and losses are allowed to be offset but the current $5,000 is not?

I really wouldn't want to pay taxes on all the gains of this stock because i held a -$5,000 option.

If i hold this $5,000 position. Am i just not allowed to deduct $5,000 in losses are all my trades from 7 months stack on the cost basis?

Any tax guys on here know?"

471,2021-12-31 07:06:29,"Stock Market Prediction with Artificial Intelligence - Anyone used such a tool?I guess this subreddit is the ultimate place to ask this question.

Stock market is extremely difficult to predict and there are multiple things that affect the changes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is heavily used in this domain and AI solutions is essentially on the way to replace human traders.

\- Does anyone use a tool/product that gives predictions on stock prices in the stock market?  
\- Do such tools help for taking better decisions?

It is very difficult for such a tool to be 100% accurate but the predictions can essentially be used as a second opinion.

The tool can give predictions in different aspects i.e.

\- What is the probability of a given stock to go up or down in the next 5 minutes? (This is extreme scenario and sounds a bit like difficult to solve.)  
\- What is the probability of a given stock to go up or down on the next day? (This (comparably) sounds like a more reasonable problem.)  
\- Or the same prediction for the next coming week or next month, for mid/long term  
thinkers...

Does anyone use such a tool? How happy are you in that case with the solution you are using?"
472,2021-12-31 06:41:58,"Did Robinhood use our accounts in Nov for micro transactions?I was reviewing my November Robinhood statement and saw some strange activity - buying, cancel buys (BCXL) and selling small amounts of GME and BB, landing me a whopping $0.27 profit. This definitely wasn't me and I don't even have BB in my portfolio at all. I have a very boring portfolio with standard stocks, no fancy options ever. This is the only month this has ever happened.

I figured it was some strange fraud attempt and did all the usual security stuff, but then noticed two even weirder things. 1) There is NO other indication that this activity ever happened. No notifications, no emails, nothing in my ""history"" and 2) my partner had the same weird micro transactions on his account in November, too.  

Uhhh, what? Can other people check if there was random activity recently in their accounts that ONLY showed up on their statement? What is this?

EDIT: Waiting for confirmation from RH, but I’m pretty sure me and my partner’s issue was a trade correction from trades I made earlier in the year. I don’t hold the stock anymore but I did in the past and so did he. I suspect this is the case for most folks who had a similar issue, though some say they NEVER held the stock so… good luck with that. 

All that said, it’s incredible that RH wouldn’t inform users that they would be doing this, because as a lot of other commenters thought, it looks a lot like fraudulent trading! I’m a very casual, low stakes investor so RH worked for me. I’ll definitely be changing brokerages now. Better late than never."

It also is luring children onto the dark web through discord to circumvent the Roblox store. Then they also may be exploited by developers through discord, getting wrapped up in all sorts of nasty shit that comes with the cutthroat business world.

I posted about it on social media and got a heartbreaking experience of a friends parents having to deal with a sexual predator on the platform and they were able to get zero help from Roblox and the predator was able to cover up everything and vanish.

489,2021-12-30 21:33:47,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Dec 30, 2021. Please enjoy! 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 30, 2021**

After starting the day green, stocks closed modestly lower, slipping in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested newly released labor market data and surging coronavirus cases across the world due to the Omicron variant. 

Given we are in the last few session of the year, volume had dried up considerably. For example, in the last four or five trading sessions, the S&P 500 (SPY) has traded roughly half its average volume. The fact that stocks are holding up so well despite volume drying up is very encouraging going into next year.

**Notable Numbers** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.28%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.35%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.24%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.04%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.36%
* Sea Limited (SE): +4.86%
* SoFi Technologies: +10.02%
* Upstart (UPST): +4.97%
* Affirm (AFRM): +5.63%
* Biogen (BIIB): -7.09%
* DraftKings (DKNG): +7.07%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

In response, airlines canceled thousands of flights, both domestic and international, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially advised people to avoid cruise ships regardless of vaccination status. As a result, both airline and cruise line stocks underperformed the market. On a personal note, after the last two years, I couldn’t get paid to go on a cruise. 

Despite this, the CDC eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)

In other news, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, showing initial and continuing jobless claims continue to come in at historic lows, signaling a tight labor market.  First-time unemployment filings fell further from last week’s reading, coming in at 198,000 — below the expected 206,000. Earlier in December, jobless claims fell to 188,000 — its lowest level since 1969.

Meanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Thursday, Samsung BioLogics denied earlier reports that Samsung subsidiary was in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen (BIIB), which was in the spotlight on Wednesday after shares of the drugmaker surged during intraday trading following a report by the Korea Economic Daily, which cited investment banking sources. The report said Biogen approached Samsung to buy its shares in a deal that could be valued at more than $42 billion.

* Tesla (TSLA) needs to recall over 475,000 Model 3 and Model S cars after the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said rearview cameras mounted on these units are in risk of malfunctioning. 
* Amid the intense regulatory crackdown, the top 10 richest tech executives in China have lost a combined $80 billion. Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang lost the most this year -- $42.9 billion, or two-thirds of his fortune -- as shares of the e-commerce platform plunged from a high of $212 to just $54
* Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group will cease operation of its online crowdfunded medical aid program Xianghubao on Jan. 28 citing “significant changes’ amid the government’s regulatory crackdown. It really has not been a good year for Chinese stocks

Despite a year marked by underperformance, Wood is keeping pace with the disruptive innovation strategy that positioned her as a bull market poster child last year after her allocations to the so-called “stay-at-home” picks that benefited from COVID-19 lockdowns earned her an annual return of 150%. Even as those stocks fall out of favor, Wood, whose firm declined a request for an interview, is sticking to her plan, arguing that naysayers should instead be worried about “safe” indexes like the S&P 500 with values she says have soared above those of the underlying companies they track.

Wood has doubled down on her stance that she can do just that, shrugging off losses and dismissing fears of a “bubble,” even as it stands to be tested by the sell-off of high-growth tech stocks likely to be worsened next year if the Federal Reserve acts on expectations to raise interest rates as many as three times, making such companies particularly vulnerable.

Next year will be a really challenging year for Ark funds as federal reserve will raise rate at least 3 time. It is almost to the end of year and investors should reevaluate if ark funds could still generate a positive return for 2022. Investors might easily lose direction since many of them just follow the trend and buy into the funds without really understanding what kind of stocks that the funds are holding."

517,2021-12-30 15:11:42,"CUE Health ($HLTH)**The Thesis for Cue Health ($HLTH) :**

**This is my first big write up so please be friendly and constructive with your comments :)**

As many of you all are aware, with what seems like the 100th strain of COVID-19— Omicron— spreading across the world, COVID-testing kits are once again in hot demand. I’m doing this write up to explain my bullish stance on COVID test kit suppliers going forward.

**Why Test Kits :**

* It is clear that we will have to co-exist with COVID, so shutting down our economy is not an option. Thus, mass-vaccination and testing have become the optimal strategies.
* Given vaccination rates have plateaued, nation-wide testing is the best thing we can do to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.

**Context:**

The Omicron variant, which now is the dominant (and most contagious) strain in the United States, has driven daily US COVID cases past the Delta variant’s peak. However, the United States severely lags behind European countries for COVID testing. In these countries, such test kits are ubiquitous, while there is a test kit shortage at US retailers. For instance, those in the US have to spend at least $14 for a two-pack at U.S retailers, compared with $5 or less in some countries, such as Germany (WSJ). The U.K government distributes free tests to its citizens on a weekly basis. While the countries’ differing healthcare systems contribute to this, it is undeniable that there exists a severe COVID testing shortage in the United States. In fact, President Biden admitted last week that “I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion \[tests\] two months ago, before Covid hit here.”

As such, there should be no doubt that the United States government will become more proactive in its acquisition of test kits, emulating the U.K and other European countries, which are giving out so many free kits so people can test themselves every week.

The Biden Administration recently announced the purchase of 500 million home kits. The contracts to purchase the tests have not been finalized, but even if we were to conservatively assume an average purchase price of $15, that is $7.5 billion going into the COVID test kit supplier market. To put that into perspective, the largest federal contracts that have been granted to COVID-test manufacturers are around $500-600 million with Celltrion and Abbott.

**Bottomline: Omicron is SPREADING FAST, and the lack of supply for test kits creates an asymmetric demand/supply relationship, with the government compounding the price inelasticity of demand. The few companies that are able to supply up-to-par test kits have strong pricing power.**

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/23/us/omicron-case-count.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/23/us/omicron-case-count.html)

**Overview of COVID Test Manufacturing Market:**

The market is pricing for a mild growth in the next two years yet underestimated the recent momentum. The testing trend is top-down and is only beginning to develop. First, the DoD or HHS will start granting generous contracts to vamp up manufacturing capacity; as Omicron continues to spread, businesses and organizations will purchase large quantities of tests for their employees to minimize disruption from the pandemic; massive and regular testing will become the norm: households and businesses will order tests in bulk orders on a regular basis.

**Why Should I Invest In Cue Health ($HLTH) ?**

Out of the various COVID testing manufacturers, Cue Health ($HLTH) is one of the best out there with over $480 million in federal contracts as well as To-B contracts with Google, Mayo Clinic, the NBA, Canada Air etc. Rather than making antigen rapid tests, Cue developed the NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification) testing method. As of this moment, Cue is the only NAAT test manufacturer that has developed its own integrated platform solution and can manufacture in-house. Mayo Clinic conducted thorough research and concluded that Cue’s home testing kits results have a 98% match (vs. \~85% sensitivity for Antigen tests) with PCR Lab results.

TLDR: Cue’s testing method is revolutionary by producing testing results virtually identical to those conducted in a professional lab in under 20 minutes !!

As a result of its superior testing capacity, Cue Health demands a high premium for its kits, which so far its clients (the federal government, premier healthcare providers, prestigious national sports leagues etc.) are willing to pay for. Aside from its top-notch caliber of clientele, Cue’s 60% GM and 10%+ NI business, along with their recent IPO, will inject them with enough cash to expand on their product offerings outside of Covid testing. This will in turn generate more cash to capitalize even more on their superior technology, creating an upward flywheel effect.

Moreover, it is very likely that Cue Health will be one of the beneficiaries (gain new federal contracts) under the recent initiatives from the Biden Administration. Its $481 mill contracts last year in October include both capex on new manufacturing facilities and $6 mill testing kits. The company sees its capex expand rapidly in that quarter from $4.8 million to $30.5 million in Q1FY21 and 27.1 million in Q2. Since Capex decreased to $19.3 million next quarter, we can reasonably estimate that total capex will be south of 100 mill, since the company will finish ramping up its manufacturing capacity within a year. This implies that each testing kit for Cue costs around $60 (way higher than the average Antigen kit). Given that their 12-month TTM revenue of $438.9 million and the majority of their revenue is, for now, federal contracts, it can be estimated that they’ve at least delivered 4 million testing kits as of today. It is very likely that they will gain a decent piece of the 500-million testing kits federal contract.

**The Bear Case:**

South Africa’s decline in COVID cases may suggest that its Omicron peak has passed. It will be worth observing whether this decline occurs in the United States. If cases steadily decrease, this might prompt investors to believe that testing demand will start dying down once again, causing selling pressure.

**Mitigating Factors:**

The Biden Administration, along with many influential people in the healthcare community have expressed their regrets over not escalating testing programs, reiterating that they will not repeat their mistake of distributing enough COVID to help combat potential surges. Furthermore, a vast majority of Cue’s clients will still require Cue’s products and services. The federal government and businesses will still need to test their employees on a regular basis; travelers will still need negative results to be cleared for cross-border traveling. Therefore, while the eventual dying-down of Omicron might affect market sentiment, its fundamentals remain robust as there will always be a huge need for rapid COVID testing.

**Conclusion:**

Going forwards, we will be seeing a fundamental shift in attitudes and business behaviors regarding COVID-testing in the United States. As Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories acknowledges that “we can’t be caught flat-footed again \[in regards to the severe shortage of testing\].” Any short-term concerns on whether testing demand would die down have now completely dissipated. This tailwind will certainly last well into 2022 and potentially further down the road as it is almost consensus now that we will co-exist with COVID. As long as that is the case, Cue Health ($HLTH) will stand to be one of our largest winners .

526,2021-12-30 12:05:45,"Lemonade dd ($LMND) a speculative play in the old insurance market.Today if you scream ""AI"" you get a market cap in the billions. Lots of bs out there. Lemonade might be just that, but it piqued my interest: I find their story captivating. So here are my two cents:

Main reasons to be bullish about this company:

1. INSURANCE IS A DINOSAURS MARKET. The insurance market has not changed for centuries. The same dinosaurs players have been going around for ages, and they have neither the will nor the ability to adjust to a disruptive change in technology and business model. The average age of the biggest insurance companies is 125 years old. The insurance market is huge. In the US it is about 11% of GDP, and it is almost 5 trillion dollars worldwide. To get incredible returns you do not need to bet on Lemonade putting the old insurance business out of commission: it just needs to take a single digit percentage of the US insurance market to be a fortune 100 company. Lemonade grew its customers 7 times in the last two years, maybe there is a chance this might happen.
2. HOW LEMONADE IS USING GAME-THEORY TO CHANGE THE INSURANCE MARKET. The insurance market has never been customer-centric and has tons of problems. From the customer's point of view, there is a problem of ""information asymmetry"": I know more information about how to calculate my risk profile than the insurance company, who actually needs to calculate it. This creates ""moral hazard"": I have the incentive to lie about my risk profile to get a better deal or, after being insured, I have the incentive to take more risks because I am insured anyway. On the insurance company side, on the other hand, there is a clear incentive NOT to give you money, since the more claims they deny the more robust their balance sheet is. This naturally creates a spiral of mistrust and friction between company and customers, and makes the market terribly inefficient.Lemonade wishes to change the incentives in the game. To simplify a little, the company takes a fixed percentage from you, and uses the rest to ""re-insure"" your risk. At the end, if some money is left on the table after all the claims are paid, that money goes to a charity of your choosing. This is a very ingenious way to reshape incentives: on the customer's end, you are far less inclined to lie about your risk and to embellish claims, since if you do so and you do get overpaid, you are not taking away that money from a faceless financial entity: you are taking it away from a charity you care about. On the company's end, Lemonade is far less incentivized to deny your claim, since that additional premium does not go to them but to a charity. By changing incentives in this way, Lemonade creates a virtuous cycle of mutual trust, which in the long term should lower costs, fraud and boost growth and retention rate. At least that's the plan.
3. HOW AI MAY CHANGE THE INSURANCE MARKET. The insurance market is essentially a way to monetize risk using probability theory. That is all there is to it, really: the more you are able to calculate risk, the more you will thrive in the long-term. Lemonade has a fully centralized, unified system built on AI. The system is built from scratch, using patented technology. The AI is fully integrated in every aspect of the company: you buy the insurance and you make claims mainly by chatting with a bot. This has three important consequences:

* 3.1) It cuts down the costs of insuring you quite substantially. Most insurance companies rely on people on site to sell you the insurance: you usually have to go to some office, chat with some guy who is paid by the insurance company, the guy gives you a long and boring questionnaire, makes some pre-packed offers. This is incredibly expensive to the insurance company, which either has to set up an office of its own in your town to reach you, or rely on pricey third-party brokers. Lemonade cuts this cost to basically 0. It does not matter where you are on this planet, as long as Lemonade has the paperwork to be an insurance company in your country, you can sign up online, from your bed. Because they cut down brokers, insurance can cost up to 50% less, which is a huge advantage
* 3.2) It cuts down the time to make a claim. A third of the claims you make on Lemonade are settled by the AI in seconds. This is of course great for customers, and should boost retention rates and ratings, which in turn attracts more customers: it is a catalysts for growth, while at the same time it cuts down bureaucratic costs for the company.
* 3.3) This is the most important: Insurance company is all about data. Ask yourself: in the last ten years who became the best by far at analyzing and gathering data? Insurance companies? I think it is tech companies, like Google, Facebook etc. They did it through AI and machine learning. AI is far better than humans in assessing risks. Lemonade AI is constantly gathering data from you: it registers everything: from which kind of questions you make when you buy the insurance, how long it takes you to reply, how many seconds it took you to read the terms and conditions... Compare this with how do the traditional insurance companies gather data from you when you sign up: normally you fill a questionnaire with 20 to 50 questions, and that is the bulk of the data the company gathers from you to assess the risk you represents. When you buy an insurance on Lemonade, on the other hand, the Bot gathers around 1600 ""data points"" in the first interaction only, and keeps adding more the more you interact with it. Every single data point is kept, aggregated and regression tested to find new statistical patterns. The more years the AI spends gathering data, the more exponentially better it will get at assessing risk via machine learning.All of this is simply unavailable to traditional insurance companies, nor it is likely that they will catch up soon (or ever): the Lemonade system relies on proprietary technology, and it is not easy to set up and patent a smart AI, especially if you are a centenary insurance company who is not really into technology.

&#x200B;

ALL OF THIS IS GREAT, BUT WHERE IS THE CATCH?

1. Lemonade is very young, so there are huge risks attached to it. So far it has grew its revenue at amazing pace, but it has also lost more and more money year over year! There is currently no path to profitability in place, and the company will likely remain unprofitable in the medium term (in the following 5 years for sure, and probably more). Are you willing to wait 10 to 20 years or so? Because this is a very long term investment.
2. Customer's retention rate is only 4-5 years, and they are all young people, often under 30. Young people are not great customers for insurance companies, because they do not have much to insure! Their hope is to build customer loyalty, but to do that they need to increase retention rate substantially: 4-5 years won't do. Reputation is a problem: people after a while just go back to the usual old players to ensure important stuff like their house.
3. Lemonade needs to spend a ton of money for marketing and to grow, so it is in desperate need for liquidity. Something like the Texas freeze last year can impact the availability of liquidity quite dramatically, and it is not clear how good the insurance market will be in the next 10 years.   They heavily re-insure their reinsurance, so another level of risk is with what kind of risks these contracts have, and in general how well is the re-insurer doing.
4. CEO best hobby is to dump shares, along with other people of the board. Look at [this](https://www.insiderscreener.com/en/company/lemonade-inc): it's like they are betting on who can dump the fastest.

Key takeaways:

* The insurance market is old and open to being disrupted.
* Lemonade may be disruptive for the insurance market, because of its business model built on changing incentives and cutting down costs, providing better margins.
* Lemonade may be disruptive for its top-down use of AI to gather data and assessing risks.
* There is a lot of risk ahead, since there is no path to profitability yet, and the company is very much new, making this a very long-term investment. It is therefore terribly difficult to value, if not with wild hypotheticals. The current valuation puts them at 2.45 p/b, they have negative cash flow so ROE is -25%. All useless metrics at this point in time.  At any rate, it dropped 75% from its high in January.

I currently do not hold any position in the stock, but I am watching. Sorry for typos."

I'm not that great at advanced stocks analysis and how the market works ,but let’s say I have a little bit of decent knowledge about the Science of drug development and approval, so my thesis  will be about the science of HGEN.


Humanigen 


Humanigen Is a small biopharmaceutical company was listed in the stock market in 2013. $HGEN lead product is a drug called “Lenzilumab”, this drug is an anti-human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”), I know such a big complicated words, simply it means a drug which lower major inflammation caused by Covid infection which can cause death if not handled well.



The catalyst Lenzilumab ، what is so special about it 


Lenzilumab targets the GM-CSF to fix a major problem that causes severe covid disease Something terrifying  it’s called the cytokines storm. Cytokines storm is an exaggerated response to covid infection which can cause multi-organ failure then death (1). Lenzilumab is a unique drug that target cytokines storm and the phase 3 clinical trial was successful in preventing the progress to a major disease which can cause death . 

Lenzilumab significantly improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation “ when the patient can’t breathe by his own and risk of death is high “ in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo (2). 

The study about efficacy of Lenzilumab was peer-reviewed and published by the Lancet journal it’s a big deal journal with impact Factor 79·321 which means low-grade bad studies don’t get published easily on the Lancet. 




EUA and the special 68.1% number 


$HGEN stock price right now is under 3.660$ and it reached above 28.5$ in anticipation of EUA “Emergency Use Authorization”  from FDA which failed and it blunted down to current price. Why the hell would I think about $HGEN when it failed EUA Well, because the rejection of EUA was not because lack of efficacy or major side effects but simply for lack of strong evidence . 

FDA said to HGEN in a letter  """"the agency was unable to conclude that the known and potential benefits of Lenzilumab outweighed the known and potential risks of its use as a treatment for the virus"""". 

Be aware this was before the Lancet peer-review for phase3 study which makes it easier for FDA to take a decision for EUA next time HGEN applies for EUA request. But this is a long-shot scenario that can’t justify investing in HGEN after it sank to 3.660$. Maybe 68.1% the magical number could give a reason for investing in this high-risk company? Let’s find out 




68.1% and special covid times 


Drug approval after basic R&D need rigorous, complicated, expensive, risky 4 phases studies to get approved for use. The problem with the 4 phases is not just the previous reasons . Also,  it takes so much time on average Infectious disease drug “like covid”  needs 9.7 years to succeed in clinical trials and get marketed (3). 
But, the previous slow method of approval changed with covid  drugs and vaccines can get approval in significantly less time. the FDA response to the world changing virus was slow and they have to to up there game which make FDA  invent the “ fast-track clinical trials “ this type of trials may take less than a year for use of drugs or vaccines instead of 9.7 years as before COVID. 
Which make me think about a quote 
  “”War has always been the mother of invention”” . COVID was the nuclear bomb dropped on the FDA ,it forced the organization to be faster and more efficient. 

Biotech and pharmaceutical companies have great potential with covid related Drugs or vaccines, it’s a new era that may change the future of pharma industry for the better or worse . 




68.1 % you may win big? 


Drug need to succeed on 4 phases of clinical trials from phase 1 to 4 . Every phase will not start until the previous phase succeed. For Monoclonal antibody like HGEN drug:

* Phase 1 trial  success rate: 54.7%

* Phase 2 trial success rate: 34.1 % “most critical one “ 

* Phase 3 trial success rate: 68.1 % this is the magical number . This trial is the longest and most expensive and it’s the trial that can make the stock  for a “new” company go all-time high or all-time low. If the drug succeed at this trial 95.4% it will get approval then marketed this why it’s the most important trial (3). Lenzilumab is in this trial and it’s succeed at the phase 3 primary endpoints . But, FDA doesn’t joke around and felt that the drug need more data which motivated the Lancet peer-review study to give FDA more Data to take the decisions for approval . 

* Phase 4 trial: is a very big study after “approval” that can fail  and drug can be withdrawn from the market but it’s rare .phase4  is not relevant to HGEN thesis , Phase3 success is the most relevant phase for HGEN .

Peer-review  is the evaluation of study by one or more people with similar competencies . Which also  supported Lenzilumab efficacy  “” Lenzilumab significantly improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo”” (4). 

Reaching Phase 3 in pre covid takes so much time “ 9.7 years” now it can take less than a year for covid related drugs, vaccines to get approved. 

The success rate for phase 3 clinical trial is 68.1%  In other words the likelihood of success for investment in a company who reached phase 3 clinical trial like HGEN is 68.1% . “In theory “

Based on previous reasoning , I think real potential is there for HGEN , But opinion doesn’t matter when there’s high risk for loss of investment  , let’s dive into more of the thesis and discuss the next point , HGEN competitors. 




Competition of similar drugs and interesting finding 

I was researching drugs that compete with HGEN drug Lenzilumab I found the drug Sotrovimab developed by Vir Biotechnology  and GlaxoSmithKline. Sotrovimab got approval from the FDA which is not exactly like Lenzilumab in terms of the exact mechanism of action but they all considered “Monoclonal antibody” so they share similarities. I did a bit of analysis for phase 3 clinical trials for each drug, In summary: 

LENZILUMAB phase3 trial 
LENZILUMAB EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN NEWLY HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 SUBJECTS: RESULTS FROM THE LIVE-AIR PHASE 3 RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL (4)

* Number of patients: lenzilumab n=236 , n=243 placebo . 

* Efficacy vs Placebo: survival without invasive ventilation was 84% for Lenzilumaband 78% for placebo.

* Adverse events: 27% Lenzilumab vs 33% placebo .

Sotrovimab phase 3 trial
Early Treatment for Covid-19 with SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody (5).

* Number of patients: Sotrovimab n=291 , placebo n=292.

* Efficacy: 1% of Sotorvimab and 7% of the placebo group developed disease progression leading to hospitalization or death 

* Adverse events: 17% for sotrovimab vs 19% placebo 

Basic summary are written above for both drugs now let’s dive into the analysis:
 
I was trying to analyze both studies for HGEN drug Lenzilumab who still Did not get approval and for VIR drug Sotrovimab who Did get approval. While trying to find if one drug is better than the other to know Why  FDA  approved  Sotrovimab  and  did  not  approve  Lenzilumab. I  found something  interesting ! 
, 
Lenzilumab efficacy: 84% had positive responses.

Sotrovimab efficacy: 99% had positive responses .

At first glance, you may assume that 99% is better than 84%, but let’s do further analysis and take the Placebo sample for Lenzilumab and sotrovimab
,

Placebo sample vs Lenzilumab sample 

Placebo sample 78% had positive response vs 84% for Lenzilumab. Meaning، adding Lenzilumab improved outcomes by 6%.

Placebo sample vs sotrovimab sample 

Placebo sample 93% had positive response vs 99% for sotrovimab sample . sotrovimab 1% developed severe symptoms vs 7% on the placebo sample . Meaning, adding sotrovimab improved outcomes by 6% just like lenzilumab. 




The interesting finding is “Placebo problem” with sample maybe Lenzilumab is better? 


Connecting the dots , as you can see the sample tested for lenzilumab had much more severe disease vs sotrovimab by evidence that the placebo group 93% improved for sotrovimab study vs 79% placebo group improved for Lenzilumab study which can mean that in the future independent studies  “less than a year , Q1 or Q2 is the most probable"" , done by unbiased institutions HGEN drug Lenzilumab may have an advantage over Sotrovimab and get approval, This is where ACTIV-5/BET-B study came to play which I will explain my reasoning about it after the next section . 


Recently, another lancet study about sotrovimab may be the reason where lenzilumab shine over competition I will discuss it next . 




Further evidence for the potential of Lenziluamb over the competition 

As I said before Lenzilumab is a Monoclonal antibody there are other drugs under the same class like sotrovimab and Amubarvimab / Romlusevimab (BRII-196/BRII-198). The previous drugs are Monoclonal antibody drugs. In a new study published by the lancet: “Neither sotrovimab nor BRII-196 plus BRII-198 showed efficacy for improving clinical outcomes among adults hospitalised with COVID-19” (6) .this study is potentially damaging on sotrovimab  and potentially can clear the way for better Monoclonal antibody drug like Lenziluamb to get approval.  





Conclusion 

HGEN drug Lenzilumab is successful in phase 3 clinical trial that did not get approval because FDA need more data. Sotrovimab is a drug developed by VIR did get approval despite “similar” outcomes for both sotrovimab and lenzilumab, new study was against sotrovimab which can clear the way for lenziluamb to prove itself against the competition. Phase 3 clinical trial has 68.1% success rate and for a small pharmaceutical company, approval means profit therefore stock price will go up. VIR stock price is 41$ and HGEN stock price is 3.660$ if HGEN drug get approval stock price may reach above 40$ like the direct competitors VIR ?.




Strength of the  thesis 

Phase3 clinical trial approval success rate is 68.1 %  and lenzilumab met its primary efficacy criteria and it wait for FDA approval .
Lenzilumab may be better then direct competitor sotrovimab who got approved by evidence that placebo group for lenzilumab phase 3 study 78% improved vs lenzilumab 84% and for sotrovimab phase 3 study 93% improved vs sotrovimab 99% which indicate that high PLACEBO improvement means the sample of study for sotrovimab have mild disease and this why it was effective, If it was tested in sample with severe disease like lenzilumab it will fail and I was right the new lancet study prove it (6) . If FDA approve the best drug then lenzilumab has a high chance of approval because it’s better then all ready approved Sotrovimab. 
If lenzilumab future study “31 December”  proved its efficacy then Lenzilumab  can be  approved by FDA ,Price may reach above 40$ for HGEN. Lenzilumab until now doesn’t have independent studies against its efficacy like the case for sotrovimab , BRII-196 plus BRII-198(6) . 

ACTIV-5/BET-B study on lenzilumab is the breakpoint  either approval of or failing . ACTIV-5/BET-B study will end in “31 December” and result of this study will not take more than 12 months to be published (7-8). 


68.1% you may win…




Weakness of the thesis 

Based on  this study (6)  Monoclonal antibody drugs are not that effective , Is HGEN drug Lenzilumab really so special, I don’t know , I’m betting it’s special based on phase 3 clinical trial but future study may prove otherwise. Rejection of EUA from FDA give lenzilumab a bad rep that it’s not effective and  investors in pharmaceuticals worst nightmare is ineffective drug.

 Drug discovery for covid is moving fast and by next year maybe there will be better drugs than lenzilumab . There’s concerns about HGEN low cash on hand for supporting its lead product Lenzilumab next year , there’s considerable chance HGEN will be bought out by big pharmaceutical company . 

Finally , this is my first thesis some information may not be accurate , the possibility of me writing،predicting  something stupid is high,Be aware and feel free to correct any information if you have evidence. 


31.9% you may loss…





Special thanks for Barney he helped my research about the “Pepe Silvia” situation and now he helped me researching HGEN.

HRTX Short Interest - HRTX is currently sitting at 34.21% short interest float with an average of 24.31 days to cover. It has 99.7 Million public float with 34 million of the shares being shorted. With each passing Short Interest report this number only goes up. It is not going up linearly either it is going up exponentially with every passing report more and more shares are being shorted. 

Earning and revenue - In the past three years HRTX has shown positive revenue at about 21% per year, yet its earnings have not been profitable. It’s strong revenue suggests it is not a dying company. 

My Full Opinion on this stock - To start out with how I view HRTX I thought it would be best to provide an analogy for it. This stock has bloomed and produced fruit, but it will be all for nothing unless we let it ripen. It is very clear that this stock is majorly undervalued by the market right now, and with the exponentially increasing short interest it is a very good candidate for a breakout. I expect it will continue its decline but a reversal is ready to happen anytime. 

I will keep everyone updated on developments with this stock and when I think it will be “ripe” any additional information or analysis you have of this stock would be greatly appreciated as this could be a major opportunity for big gains.

I bought single stocks and sold covered calls on all year, and was making great money growing my account like $2k-$3k a month, and just taking out some chunks of money when I needed it, but then in Nov and Dec my stocks I was in all went down like 30-40%, (Roku, Pypl, and Penn) and wiped out all the gains I made in Jan through October. I sold some of the shares that I bought at the highest prices off at a loss here in the last couple weeks to offset my gains for tax purposes. But I still own and am still down on my acct right now. Mostly in Roku, Pypl, and Penn that I’m down the most on although my V, and Dis are still down a few percent also.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 29, 2021**

Stocks ended the day mostly flat in a pretty uneventful day as the stock market took a breather from the four-day Santa Claus rally that saw the S&P 500 (SPY) gain roughly 4% in just over a week. With no new economic data being released this week and the year coming to a close, volume in the market has dried up, with volume in SPY coming in at roughly 50% average volume. I expect the market to be mostly flat for the rest of the week then pick up once again in 2022.

**Notable Numbers**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.13%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): Closed even
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.24%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.13%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.16%
* Biogen (BIIB): +9.57%
* FuelCell Energy (FCEL): -12.95%
* Astra Space (ASTR): -14.14%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

Erin Gibbs. Chief Investment Officer at Main Street Asset Management, said “We encourage our clients to stay in the markets, not to get out, because when those recoveries hit and when the sentiment changes, it happens so quickly that often by the time you get back into the market, you’ve already missed out.” Remember, time in the market is always better than timing the market.

First-time unemployment filings are expected to tick up slightly from last week’s reading but remain near pre-pandemic lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market as high demand for workers pours into the new year.

“We’re facing some headwinds that could challenge the bull market continuing to run,” Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re looking at a 40-year inflation... the consumer's continued relatively strong… we’re looking at interest rates right now at 40-year lows.”

**Highlights**

* Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has sold another 934,090 shares, or about $1.02 billion worth of his holdings, in his electric car company according to financial filings published late Tuesday.
* The National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) [Pending Home Sales Index dropped 2.2%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pending-home-sales-november-2021-150010616.html) in November from the prior month, missing analyst expectations. The index, which tracks the number of homes that are under contract to be sold, serves as a leading indicator of the housing market's health.
* The [U.S. trade deficit in goods ballooned](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-goods-trade-deficit-hits-135842273.html) to a record in November as imports soared and exports fell. The Commerce Department reported that the goods trade deficit expanded by 17.5% last month to $97.8 billion from $83.2 billion in October. The new figure tops the previous record deficit of $97 billion posted in September. Goods exports declined 2.1%, while imports rose by 4.7%.
* Amid the intense regulatory crackdown, the top 10 richest tech executives in China have lost a combined $80 billion. Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang lost the most this year -- $42.9 billion, or two-thirds of his fortune -- as shares of the e-commerce platform plunged from a high of $212 to just $54
* Ford Motors (F) is slightly more valuable than General Motors for the first time since 2016.
* Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group on Wednesday said it was restructuring its local management at its Sriperumbudur facility in southern India amid a strike by workers there. 
* According to a report by Bloomberg, Alibaba (BABA) will likely divest its stake from Twitter-like platform Weibo amid regulatory pressure. 
* Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group will cease operation of its online crowdfunded medical aid program Xianghubao on Jan. 28 citing “significant changes’ amid the country’s regulatory crackdown. It really has not been a good year for Chinese stocks

550,2021-12-29 21:09:53,"P/E ratio isn't everything, but it would do a lot of good for some people to take it in consideration when investingI see so many people on this sub and other finance-related subs recommend certain stocks simply because they're great companies. A lot of people seem to fail to realize the fact that the expected growth and development of some companies is already priced into their stock price and that their investment isn't as valuable as they might think. This is especially relevant if you're in those companies for the long run, and not just trying to hedge some profits out of short term price movements.

Two major examples of those kinds of overvalued stocks (in my opinion) come to my mind: Costco ($COST) and Nvidia ($NVDA).

$COST: Costco is currently trading with a P/E ratio of almost 50 (so their annual earnings are close 1/50 or 2% of their market cap). However, the average P/E ratio in the sector of consumer services is in the 20's. That doesn't directly mean that Costco is a bad investment, but it means that Costco must be expected to grow bloody rapidly within the next few years for it to be worth its current trade price. The thing is, Costco is already an established company with a limited potential for further growth as its already at the top of its sector and gives a lot of its earnings away in the form of dividends instead of reinvesting them into their development. Does that mean that Costco is overvalued at the moment? There can't be an objective answer to that, but you better have a damn good reason to think it's still worth it to invest in Costco, and not just that it's a great company.

$NVDA: Nvidia is currently trading at a P/E ratio around 100 while the average P/E for tech stocks is of 35. Again, you must have a really good reason to think Nvidia, who's already at the top of the GPU market, is gonna grow rapidly within the few next years when it has competitors like AMD and Intel slowly catching up to its technlogical edge and who are slowly taking away some of its market share. Does that mean that Nvidia is overvalued? Even an insidier could have trouble telling you, but again, you must have a really solid reason to think it's still a worth it investment.

Long term investing is all about value. You're trying to find best deals in the market basically. When you do your reasearch about a company, you're trying to evaluate it and compare the intrinsic value you think it has to the value it is given by the market. A good analogy would be if you had a slight preference to Burger King over McDonald's, but Burger King's food was twice as expensive as McDonald's'. Would you still eat at Burger King? No, you'd most likely go to McDonald's because Burger King might taste a bit better, but not enough to justify its way higher price.

Another thing: I see so many people recommend stocks based on the success they've had in the past with them. It's not because that stock has been great value in the past that it will still great value in the future. The thing that annoys me the most is people that recommend buying Tesla because it's been a successful company. To be clear, Tesla has been a successful company, but the increase in its stock price didn't even nearly scale proportionately to its success. With a P/E ratio of 400, it's easy to see that the increase in Tesla's stock price was caused by the faith of investors in the company's future success and not by its past feats. In brief, the fact that a lot of people believe in a company doesn't mean that it's actually as good a company as its value tells you."

553,2021-12-29 20:26:43,"Lockheed Martin (LMT)INTRO- 

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace/defense company. It has four primary classes of products. These include Aeronautics, Missile & Fire Control, Space, & Rotary/Mission Systems. 

Another huge factor to keep in mind from the beginning is that roughly 70% of the company’s revenue is from the United States government. 

STRENGTH’S- 

- 3.17% dividend, that has consistently grown at high rates over the last few decades. They have a payout ratio of 47.93% according to YF. I would like to see this be dropped, as they really have a chance to take huge amounts of market share in untapped markets.
- Lockheed has multiple NASA contracts. They are the prime contractor for the Orion Spacecraft, which will be designed for galaxy wide exploration. Additionally, many of their contracts are for aeroshells, which are used on most modern rovers and spacecraft.
- No mission to Mars has ever occurred without some sort of a Lockheed design. 
- No company has ever landed on Mars. Besides Lockheed, and they have done it four times.
- They are developing a new technology called MAIA (Model-Based Artificial Intelligence Assistant). It allows for predictive feedback based on the surrounding environment and other factors. This tech would be implemented into every military and space vehicle they design and build. This technology is the future of warfare, and nations will line up to purchase it.
- Current ROE is 82.89%. That may be an outlier, but that is impressive.
- Shares have decreased from .427B to .277B as of 6/30/2007-9/30/2021. Nearly cut in half. We all love some share buy backs.
- The military budget has almost never been cut in US history. Obama did make some cutbacks, however Lockheed still managed to grow their earnings that year. I hate to say it, but I don’t see tensions between the world’s powers declining anytime soon. When things get worse, and they will, Lockheed will profit massively. 
- I pray I am wrong on the last point, and if so, Lockheed will still have huge upside in all area’s of the soon to come, Space Industrial Revolution. Top that with buybacks, a juicy dividend, and a constant need for defense, and I believe this is quite a safe bet.

CONCLUSION-

These are only strengths, and weaknesses still must be accounted for. Additionally, more research must be made into their financials. However, I would like to hear the community’s thoughts on the simple bull case to be made. 

For centuries, only the wealthy would ever benefit from wars. Mankind has proven time and time again, we do not know peace. The wealthy ensure this happens. Why can’t we profit off it as well?"

555,2021-12-29 20:22:17,"To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"".  They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  
XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  
DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

I've been reading up on ETN's and want to make sure I'm understanding them correctly. If anyone that has experience with them sees this, please let me know if any of the following points are incorrect:

* Since ETN's don't pay a coupon, and are unsecured, they are generally sold significantly below par
* Consider an S&P 500 tracking ETN. After being active for one year during which the S&P returned 5%, the updated par value would be initial par value \* (1.05) \* (1-expense ratio)
* The yield on any ETN would effectively be the expectations for the annualized returns on the S&P over whatever the maturity is + relevant credit and liquidity premiums.

Assuming I'm understanding this correctly, what are typical credit premiums on an ETN issued by a reputable U.S financial institution? I'm considering adding some ETN's to my portfolio as a way to outperform the S&P.

For example say ROTH IRA limit is $3000. I purchased X shares at cost $3000. Now the shares are worth 25% more or $3750. Can I transfer X shares to my IRA now, even though they are worth $3750, because I purchased them earlier this year? Or can I only transfer based on today's share price?"

571,2021-12-29 13:29:48,"Anyone else seeing huge value opportunities in this market?Is it just me, or has cheap gotten really, really cheap? No, it isn't just me. Even though value did well this year, the value spread is still near the biggest it's ever been (I like AQR's insights on this). That means that the stocks that have low P/E, P/B etc. have gotten cheaper, while those with astronomical ratios or negative earnings have gotten more expensive.

The most obvious and widely known one is probably T. Doesn't even need to be discussed, really. Buy one cheap telecom with huge earnings, get one big media/streaming company for free. Telecoms overall are unreasonably cheap... check out KT Corporation for example, it's fun.

Another one is the big Russian gas company. It's not going anywhere, being among the cheapest producers of the world's most important ""green"" energy source, with the biggest reserves on earth. Not to mention europe's suicidal energy politics. Going to get a dividend yield of 20-25% on my cost basis, would buy more but it's already over 10% of my portfolio...

Then there's VIAC, which is priced like it wouldn't even exist in five years. No, it still makes a lot of money, has a fast growing streaming service, and a huge library of content. Maybe a buyout candidate?

An interesting one is Rolls Royce. It makes stuff like plane engines and energy systems, and is researching small modular nuclear reactors which may become the saviors of the planet. Priced like it's going out of business next week with a P/E of 4.

The Crown Jewel of China, BABA. It's gotten so much hate recently that I just had to buy some. Anything sub $150 is a steal for this kind of growth and moat. I missed my chance with Amazon, so why not try with the next best thing? Worth now the risk of a ""hostile takeover"" by CCP, IMO.

Corsair. This has been popular on some unsavoury places, but maybe not entirely without merit. PC gaming is growing, so why wouldn't this stock grow too. The company isn't 50% worse than it was less than a year ago, as the share price would indicate. Hugely shorted.

Gold miners are cheap as hell while still making nice earnings. One would think that gold would get some love in an inflationary environment? I dunno, maybe it's just not that popular right now. The best time to buy.

Then there's the entire nuclear fuel market. Every investor in the know has a small stake in it, simply because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio.

Some other cheap stocks that I own but maybe wouldn't add too much at this point are MU, KHC, WBA, INTC, some small steel companies and banks. And ""cheap"" tech SPOT, TWTR.

Share your cheap stock ideas or criticize mine!

574,2021-12-29 11:19:17,"Realizing These 7 Trading Mistakes Saved Me Over $200,000 in Losses This Year If you’ve recently started trading, you’re likely very disturbed by the recent pullbacks and volatility, especially among high-flying household tech stocks like Docusign, Roku, and Teladoc, which are down 45% from recent highs. Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. 

Institutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I’d argue many stocks are still overvalued.

 I’m going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.

**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  
 While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. 

Likewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.

**Not Picking An Entry Point**

These market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don’t know if it’s a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.

Think of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don’t budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it’s a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that’s OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.

Truth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.

Being a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I’m constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I’m not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I’m not investing, I’m just gambling.

**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**

OK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. 

New support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it’s critical to track events and know what’s going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.

I use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven’t found a more efficient way of doing that.

If you’ve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I’ll note a few simple ways to do this.

**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)** \- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock’s price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it’s a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn’t get crushed. If it’s trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.

Other valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We’ll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.

So set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it’s going to get crushed every time there’s an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company’s value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.

**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**

If I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I’d be able to pay a full year’s college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.

I allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that’s pretty high, but I’m willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we’ve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don’t hold them forever.

There are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren’t overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. 

**Buying At The Peak Price**

If you’ve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you’ve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You’ve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it’s making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock’s valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You’re unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.

If the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don’t fret: you’re not alone. We’ve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it’s very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you’re taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.

There is another way to play it that’s more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.

**Losing Faith & Conviction**

After taking a beating on a stock or ten, it’s easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It’s these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you’re healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.

I write down everything I’ve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I’ve lost money. It’s now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).

If you write down what went wrong, you’re committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don’t and opt to wallow in self-pity, you’re bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you’re likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.

“When there’s blood on the streets, buy property.”

**Not Having an Exit Plan**

How much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can’t be infinity and I don’t know isn’t much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.

So what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I’ve accomplished the returns I’m looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.

Some stocks *are* long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it’s ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.

In case you’re curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.

Just remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.

Good luck."

One more milestone exists for the final 2.6 million options to vest: Tesla has to maintain 30% gross profit margins for four consecutive quarters.

Tesla’s automotive gross profit margin exceeded 30% in the third quarter of 2021. If the company can repeat that in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first two quarters of 2022, then Musk just might earn the final 2.6 million options.

**Insider Trades:** 

In August four executives bought in total an approximate £177K worth of shares. No selling has been recording in the last 12 months.

Dividend Yield of 8.6% yr if you care.

This stock’s price has fallen consistently year after year since 2017 as a result of a dying tobacco industry, but I think there is a case to be made for it being undervalued. Despite the stock falling 60%, its revenue and earnings have increased over that time and the debt has decreased. It seems to have bottomed out, as it has been flat for the year, and I am taking signs that executives are buying as a positive thing for a reversal. To me, it seems to be a perfectly fine company that people are passing on out of fear tobacco will die. What do you guys think?

I was looking into their holdings, and unsurprisingly they've begun averaging into the january contract, split about half and half. Now futures contracts are usually priced with interest rates included in further dated contracts, which means that the fund is bound to lose money over time. 

I've noticed that they carry bonds in the portfolio though and quite a significant amount too. I've also read some comments that said the fund won't actually follow the movements of bitcoin, so my question is, does these bonds actually offset the backwardation on bitcoin futures contracts, and if not, are there any scenarios that might cause BITO and other ETFs like it to deviate from the spot bitcoin price?"

593,2021-12-29 00:06:18,"Time to short Vail Resorts (MTN)?I follow stock markets loosely but I follow skiing intensely. I realize those two communities rarely overlap, but for those of you with more expertise in the former community, I invite you to deep dive Vail Resorts and look at the slow burn which has been festering over the past few years in the skiing community, particularly in the West. Vail Resorts’ business plan has them buy local ski resorts across the country and adding the resorts to their “Epic Pass” collection - a season pass which allows the holder to ski at any Vail Resorts mountain at any time - then firing many of the well paid experienced employees including all of local management, HR, customer service and Finance folks - deferring all non-core mountain ops (ski patrol, lift operators, instructors) to their Broomfield, CO headquarter office staff. This coupled with Vail’s cutthroat approach towards employee benefits and customer relations has resulted in huge staffing shortages and absolutely atrocious guest experiences at several Vail resorts, notably at Stevens Pass (WA), Afton Alps (MN), and Park City (UT), as thousands of Epic Pass holders descend on these understaffed resorts this winter. The meltdown and shitshows are visible across the web, notably on r/stevenspass and @epicliftlines (on IG). Vail leadership clearly doesn’t care and continues to issue empty apologies with no corrective action. The new CEO Ms. Lynch clearly has her work cut out. At some point (soon I think) people are going to stop buying Epic passes and switch to Alterra properties (Ikon Pass), which have demonstrated they can provide a far superior guest experience even in the current Covid environment/labor market.

MTN appears to have few retail investors (96% institutional). I wonder if it’s time to make Vail the next meme stock."

Here are mine…

I see big tech having a fairly muted year after it’s huge run, quite literally carrying indices this year. Some performing better than others. You aren’t going to sell these, but rather buy and hold on consolidation and dips. I specifically think semiconductor stocks are priced to perfection and has much of its upside priced in. Alt energy as well.

I see recovery plays finally getting a real rally, not some 3 month headfake. Not prepandemic level rally, but 60-70% retracements.

I see financial and fintech stocks putting up good years as interest rates rise from bare bottom levels.

I see growth and value as being equally favored. Expecting a slightly upward, but largely consolidated year for stocks."

597,2021-12-28 22:48:26,"Rate My CCL StratBasically title, with reasonings here.

Obviously down a lot due to covid fear and variants. Way below where it was prior to covid (even taking into account all the shares they sold, market cap is still well below that point. The equivalent to CCL's 50$ price prior to covid would be about 35$ now.

Despite variant news, forward bookings and for the second half of 2022 and 2023 look very strong, like better than pre COVID strong.  Even without all cruise ships going, the ones that ARE are seeing record on-board spending. (To be fair, pre COVID on board spending usually grew year over year already, but I would still consider the fact that it's not losing that trend a good sign)

Debts are still pretty high, in the billions, but refinancing is going well, shy of cancellations in the second half of 2022 they should be cash flow positive by then, and they've got plenty of cash on hand in case of emergencies, so they're in no danger of defaulting on loans or anything.

As for how I'm thinking of playing it:

Established in the last year or so, a couple patterns show up:

Strong floor in the 16-17 range, strong ceiling at 30-31.
Weaker floor/ceiling(depends on direction) at 20 and 25.

Plan is to buy in at the approximately 20~ dollar range, sell at approximately 25~ and repeat as it ranges between these areas.

Due to the volatility it's shown so far, and events like omicron continuing, I think within the next year I could have the opportunity to repeat this a good few times. At least two, maybe three, at 25% each.

Biggest hurdles:

Entry and exit timing. As I mentioned, my range is 20-25, but that's not an exact science.  I'm hoping I can use technicals to get a good feel for when things are turning around, but I'll be real I've been pretty dog shit at that so far, so I'm probably safer just sticking to buying and selling at 20 and 25, but we'll see how well I stick to that.

Unforeseen COVID events. (Gamma variant? Are we past that yet?) Variant news during an upswing can obviously cause problems. (Actually entered at 20 just before omicron, feels bad. Already in the green above twenty again but missing that 16-20 range hurts bad.). This is another ""hopefully I can get a feel for how things are going"" type problem, which isn't a great answer.  Thought here is during variant issues is to widen the range to the lower support at ~16.  That support has held pretty well through both delta and omicron now, so if I catch word of another I'd probably bow out, see how it tests those supports, then buy back in.  

Unforeseen COVID events can also be positive I think, (positive vaccine news, improved vax rates, less new cases) that could potentially push above 25. In this case would be the reverse of the above. Try to let it ride up to thirty.


Think that's it! Any thoughts? I'm mostly worried there's some other grand source of risk that I'm not thinking of. Part of me thinks it's also a lot of effort when I could get lucky with a growth stock and get like triple that gain, but I'm pretty bad at picking and timing those so this feels weirdly a bit safer for me. (I have a PLAN, at least. Rather than just... NIO ev go burr?)"
598,2021-12-28 22:04:23,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 28, 2021. Please enjoy! 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**

After four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. 

**Notable Numbers:** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.08%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%
* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%
* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%
* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)

In light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)

The rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.

Looking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.

**Highlights** 

* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.
* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.
* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.
* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. 
* For the first time since 2016, the S&P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.
* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites
* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up. I watched it… it was an amazing movie.

“You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don't try."" *Beverly Sills*"

**Dow: 36,398.21 (+95.83) (+0.26%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,781.72 (-89.54) (-0.56%)**

The markets were muted today with lower volumes following the rally yesterday, again on less volume. S&P and Nasdaq drifted into red, though not much, but Dow managed to stay in the green. 

Apple Inc’s retail stores in NYC were closed following other retailers doing the same on the surge in the Omicron cases. The CDC has updated its guidance on the Omicron with reducing isolation and quarantining requirements but amping up the mask guidance. It should be noted the previous guidance on isolation and quarantining requirements caused major delays and cancellations in the holiday travel over the Christmas weekend and was expected to derail school reopening plans post the holiday. 

The airlines stocks shrugged off the Omicron concern to inch up higher even while Delta airlines said they expect to cancel over 250 flights on Tuesday both due to rising cases of Omicron and adverse weather conditions. Total cancellations as of 2pm ET stood at 1,034 with 2,694 flights delayed marking fifth day of flight cancellations according to Reuters.

Cruise stocks were in news after CDC said it is actively investigating or observing 86 cruise ships following COVID-19 outbreaks onboard. The cruise lines that were affected include Disney, Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian.

EV and related shares of RIVN, GOEV, FSR, QS, SLDP, BLNK, RIDE and LIDAR stocks like LAZR, VLDR took a hit plunging around 4-5%, though on lower volumes. TSLA was down by 0.5% at closing following a steady stream of positive sessions since last Tuesday rising over 20% during the same period.

Shares of PTON continued its downward slope hitting another 52-week low today and was at $35.13 down 4.30% during the market close. Google trends data indicated the searches for Peloton is on the decline further confirming the lack of interest in the pandemic favorite fitness products."

As I'm watching CNBC, and seeing Pete and Jon talking about Disney 155 options exploding with buys, then Mr. Wonderful talking about doubling his position, I started wondering what is going on.... After doing some research, I found that Disney was just awarded today (12/28/2021) a Patent for a virtual world simulator...

Patent #11,210,843

I was just going to keep the stock until it got back up to my purchase price at 159, but after seeing this, I'm wondering if their next push is going to be into the meta-verse...

Anyone else have any opinions about Disney, and how this is going to effect their stock? I defiantly think that if they can execute, the stock is going to shoot up, and as more people find out about this, it is going to jump quickly..."
602,2021-12-28 20:19:24,"How is tax calculated for buying and selling same stock?I had made a good profit this year. but then I bought $sq way back and lost alot. then I thought I will sell $sq and buy again so that It will show net loss and I dont have to pay tax. then I realised I was being stupid and if it is this easy everybody would do the same. I did some google and realised there are few rules. what should I do now? I made good profit from other stocks, I realised the profit and now have nonrealised loss in $sq. What should I do? Do I sell $sq at the end of trading day of this year? or sell $sq and but after 30 days or what should I do to realise my loss legally so that I dont have to pay on profit which I have lost all now.

I haven't been able to pull the trigger to lower my cost basis for some of my stocks and I haven't been able to pull the trigger to buy a different stock. I've thought about Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, and others but just can't really decide or pull the trigger.

604,2021-12-28 18:23:53,"Do you think $UPST price is justified?I saw that UPST FY2021 Expected PE was around 70 if you take adjusted income, but considering stock compensation is around 130. This does not seem to be a one-time event right (tell me if I’m wrong please). So I asked myself if the company was going to grow that much in the future. 
In a photo i saw from TIKR, 2025 exp EBIT is 350-390M(≈3x FY21), ≈3,3x in revenues. I was wondering how much could they keep that pace.
Other thing, do you find upst able to counter a crysis? (I say this because of the q2 2020 revenue).

Thanks"
605,2021-12-28 18:16:41,"Where can I see daily OI increases on options?Might not be the right sub but w.e.

I cannot for the life of me find something that tracks open interest on options day to day. If OI is 20 on Monday close and 80 on Tuesday close, I do not know a site that tells me ""OI increased by 60 on Tuesday"". Like all I want is to see daily option OI increases. Is that too much to ask?

This seems like very relevant information so I'm surprised this is the case.

Since CFD do not require dividends (like futures), you can do an arbitrage the next day.

609,2021-12-28 17:27:16,"Thoughts on investing on china next year ?What are your thoughts on china's stock market next year ? it has been in a bear market since a year, HSI is up only 5% from 5Y it seems pretty oversold to me.

Ofc there are a lot of fears and uncertainties but a few positives catalysts could reverse the trend ? It has a lot of possible upside, it may offset the risks.

My point is may be it is better to stay away from USA for a while with the rising interest rate next year I am getting a bit bearish we could see some big corrections next year."
610,2021-12-28 17:18:52,"Having 2 different but similar ETFs for tax-loss harvestingI’m curious if anyone has 2 different but “similar” ETFs in their taxable account for the purpose of tax loss harvesting at year end, as we are approaching the close of 2021. For example, VXUS and IXUS both are international (ex-US) funds but hold different amounts of stocks and trade on different indices, so I’ve heard the IRS would likely let those pass for any wash sale considerations. 

Anyone use this strategy each year for long term investing? E.g.  tax loss harvest VXUS and buy IXUS at top of following year?

Thanks!"

My fidelity tax statements are showing that VOO dividends all are ordinary and not qualified. The taxes on these dividends are now much higher than expected.

Does anyone know if this is always the case? I would assume VOO would be qualified dividends as the individual components of the index fund generate qualified dividends.

Thanks in advance for any help!"
612,2021-12-28 15:54:54,"What To Do Stocks With At Major Losses? Sell For Pennies or Wait For Potential Never To Come Recovery?This is the few years where I basically made no money this year, since I made gains on certain stocks, but major losses on others that balance to right around 0. I already sold a couple to tax harvest, but at this point, not sure if worth selling more, if my realized gains are right around 0. 

There are some stocks, sort of undecided what to do, for instance I have PTON, Corsair, and Baba, all of which are down more than 50%. At the time I bought them, I liked them, but simply put seeing recent financials and company plans, sentiments have now changed. Personally, I wouldn't buy these stocks today, which might signal I should sell, however problem is having loss so much, at this point, selling means I just lock in those losses. There also aren't opportunity costs I think I can sell to buy and trade that might be worth it, for instance being the market is down, I could play defense and buy something more stable, but it's very unlikely I'll ever recover costs, if I buy something like SPY or QQQ, which will have to 2x just to breakeven. 

Any opinions or advice what to do? Sell anyway and take that as sunk costs and a loss cause or hold since we're in a down market, hoping maybe a future bull market will bring it up again, even though there's of course uncertainty with that?"

618,2021-12-28 14:49:16,"$PRDS - an asymmetrical risk/reward profileBackground:

$PRDS is a biotech company developing an antiviral pill similar to Pfizer’s Paxlovid. It just completed its merger with FSII this past Thursday. Yesterday was its first day trading under the new ticker. It’s completing Phase I trials and plans to move to Phase II and III trials in the first half of 2022. 

Thesis:

With a market cap of $600-700m and an EV of just ~$400M, the stock appears cheap on its own. It has a promising antiviral drug with a substantial TAM that, if successful, would likely yield sales equal to many multiples of the current market cap each year (for Pfizer’s drug, analysts are estimating tens of billions in sales per year). The company claims its drug could be superior to Pfizer’s, because it doesn’t require a “booster” of an HIV drug to be taken concurrently, like Pfizer’s does. Those HIV drugs have a high level of interactions with other drugs, including common statins, which can limit its appeal to certain segments of the market. 

Other positive factors include: (i) a substantial investment from Gilead via the PIPE (indicating both confidence in the drug as well as a big pharma partner lined up to help with production);(ii) the pre-merger CEO bought $3.5M of shares at $10 last week; and (iii) very low (less than 2%) redemptions. 

The real kicker, though, is that it appears that the company has a patent that *might* cover Pfizer’s drug. Take a look at this tweet from a professor at Stanford where he indicates his view that the patent likely does cover Paxlovid. 

https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1465446964879835137

As soon as the market senses a whiff of a lawsuit for the hottest drug currently in existence, the stock will rerate much much higher, in my opinion. 

Summary:

At ~$11 a share, the max downside is $11, which will likely require both (i) a trial failure for PRDS’s drug candidate AND (ii) the inability to sue Pfizer over the patent. If either of those conditions are not met, I estimate the upside to conservatively be $200 a share, and potentially much much higher. That’s why this is an asymmetric risk/reward play, imo.

I am long $PRDS"

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****

*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****

620,2021-12-28 12:51:12,"The SEC Is Going Too Easy on Insider Trading - Investors need to know more about executives’ stock-selling plans.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-28/the-sec-is-going-too-easy-on-insider-trading

At long last, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sketched out a plan to address a difficult issue in the U.S. stock market: how and when corporate insiders, who inevitably have better information than the investing public, can legally trade in the shares of their companies.

The proposal is good, as far as it goes. But it could do a lot more to assure regular investors that insiders aren’t taking advantage of them.

Under current rules, executives and directors can largely avoid charges of illegal insider trading by setting up a predetermined schedule of sales or purchases, known as a 10b5-1 plan. Yet if they know that their company is about to do a big deal or report some bad news, there are still plenty of ways they can use such plans to act on the information. They can set one up for a single trade and act on it the next business day. They can set up multiple plans, then cancel the disadvantageous ones at any moment. It’s hard for the public to understand what’s going on, because many of the relevant details of the plans typically aren’t disclosed or are hard to find.

Now the SEC is moving to make the plans harder to game. Its proposed new rule would establish a 120-day cooling-off period before a first trade can be executed — long enough to erase any informational advantage the insider might have when a plan is created. It would limit single-trade plans to one per year, and effectively disallow executives to have multiple plans simultaneously. All these are positive changes. But in other areas, particularly public disclosure, the SEC’s proposal falls short.

Right now, when an executive creates or terminates a 10b5-1 plan, it’s up to the company to decide whether or not to disclose the move. For example, as far back as 2004, Cisco Systems would regularly file 8-K disclosures about such plans, including the executive’s name, the number of shares and the timeframe for the sales. But starting in 2018, the company stopped providing that level of detail, with no explanation. Absent any formal rules, the company and its lawyers could pick and choose what they wanted to reveal.

The new proposal would require companies to disclose the plans in their quarterly 10-Q financial reports, with some added information (on stock options, for example) in their annual 10-K reports. That’s not good enough. To be truly useful to investors, the disclosure should happen as soon as the plans are created or canceled – for example, under 8-K rules that require filing within four business days, as the SEC’s own investor advisory committee recommended.

Why would the SEC go against investors’ recommendations? Most likely, to satisfy the two Republicans among the agency’s five commissioners – one of whom, Elad Roisman, publicly stated that “this wasn’t the rule I would have written.” The proposal ultimately garnered unanimous support, a rarity in these times of political divisiveness. But even the modest disclosures it requires could yet be watered down or eliminated when corporate law firms start chiming in.

Recent history isn’t encouraging. The SEC was actually more ambitious in 2002, when it proposed that 10b5-1 plans be subject to 8-K disclosure. But various commenters, including large brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, complained that the requirement would “confuse investors.” Others objected to the added paperwork. The idea was dropped.

As an avid reader of SEC filings, I’ve long argued that more and better disclosure benefits all investors, even if it means a bit more work for the folks that prepare these documents. The latest proposals, assuming they survive corporate lobbying, are a step in the right direction. But they still won’t provide nearly enough information in a way that matters for ordinary investors."
621,2021-12-28 12:44:26,"Visa vs Mastercard: Is there a difference between them?I have yet to see a good argument for buying one over the other. If anyone has read one, please post it here.

Other than the hedge funds owning Mastercard, I have not been able to find out why. Does anyone know?

Here Are the Catalysts for More UpsideTesla “is in a clear position of strength heading into 2022,” according to analysts at Wedbush, who see three catalysts, including China demand, driving the stock higher. Wedbush has a current base price target on Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares of $1,400 and a bull case target of $1,800. The Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, wrote in a note they were maintaining their Outperform rating on the stock.

Tesla closed at $1,093.94 on Monday, up 2.52%. The stock has gained 55% in 2021 and its market capitalization has moved above $1 trillion.

Ives said the “linchpin to the overall bull thesis on Tesla remains China,” and he estimated the country will make up 40% of deliveries for the electric-vehicle maker in 2022. He also said China was worth $400 a share to Tesla next year. The analyst said Tesla has a “high-class problem of demand outstripping supply” and said the key to alleviating these issues centered around Gigafactory openings in Austin, Texas and Berlin that will “alleviate the bottlenecks of production for Tesla globally.”

“We believe by the end of 2022 Tesla will have the capacity for overall \~2 million units annually from roughly 1 million today,” Ives said. The EV maker also should be able to smooth out supply-chain issues that have been a drag on overall unit growth for Tesla in 2021, according to Ives. “While logistical hurdles will be a near-term cost burden, we importantly believe Tesla has the potential to further expand its auto \[gross margin\] and profitability profile over the next 12 to 18 months especially with more higher-margin cars being sold and produced in China,” Ives added.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

627,2021-12-28 09:02:05,"Why Visa Stock is Underperforming the Market, But Still a Strong Buy Moving ForwardFULL Articles with Photos [Here](https://www.investingupgraded.com/post/a-dividend-investor-s-viewpoint-on-visa)

Visa Inc. is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa provides one of the world's most advanced digital payment solutions with transaction processing speed at near instantaneous levels for customers around the globe; VisaNet handles about 150 million transactions daily.   

Visa stock has been a laggard in the market as of late. In Q3 2020, Visa stock underperformed the S&P 500 by over 12%. This was largely due to an earnings miss for Visa's fiscal year 2020 and higher-than expected costs related to its acquisition of Visa Europe. However, it is important to note that both these issues have been resolved and analysts are now bullish on what lies ahead for this company. The question becomes: should you buy shares now?   

**Visa P/E Ratio**

Visa's historical P/E hovers around 30x - 45x. Its' current P/E ratio sits around 45.01x which is aligned closely to historical values. Visa's P/E has increased in 2021 due to the stock price dropping through the last half of the year and its overall stagnant price throughout 2021.   

Visa is currently trading at a P/E ratio that is lower than the market average. This means that Visa may be a good investment because it gives investors more upside than downside.       

**Revenue**
Visa's revenue has recently returned to be on trend with is revenue growth prior to the COVID-19 impact in Q1 and Q2 2020. In fact, Visa's TTM Revenue CAGR is 28.58% and I expect that to continue due to the Holidays. This will allow Visa to continue the growth of their dividend into the future.    

This increase is due to higher operating margin rates across all regions as well as lower tax expenses because of domestic production deductions under U.S Tax Reform Act (U.S.). The strong growth in Visa's operating margin rate across all regions was primarily due to higher service and royalty fees, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. This strong performance enabled Visa to deliver a dividend yield of 0.61% on June 20th, 2021, which is the highest it has been since 2015 when its' yield was at 0.72%   

**Visa Free Cash Flow**
Visa's Free-Cash-Flow or FCF is at an all-time high. Visa reported free cash flows around $14.5 billion in September 2021, up from $9.3 billion in December 2020. This is a 36% increase in nine months with more expected in Q4 2021. Visa's TTM FCF CAGR is even higher at 49.65% which is quite impressive considering the stock price.   

**Visa Profit Margin** 

Visa has kept their profit margins around 45% with them reporting 51% in September 2021. These are healthy profit margins and are higher than other competitors like MasterCard, Square, and American Express. Its closest competitor, $MA, has a profit margin around 45%. Coupled with increased holiday spending and increased vendor fees I expect Visa to continue leading the pack into the future.   

**Visa Dividend Yield & Dividend Yield on Cost**

Visa's **dividend yield**, as of 27 December 2021, sits at .61% which is higher than its average over the past five years. This is due the price dropping in 2021. The difference in dividend yield compared to historical averages doesn't warrant jumping in based on the yield alone.   

For the past four years, Visa's dividend yield has been around 0.60%. Visa is confident that it can pay out its current annual dividend due to its excellent access to new opportunities in both the United States and China. VISA's current annual dividend is $0.38 per share of Visa common stock per quarter. This amounts to a yearly dividend of $1.58 for every share of Visa stock owned by an individual investor. Is the dividend worth the sideways action we've seen with Visa? 2021 YTD Visa has returned -0.6% which is significant underperformance when compared to the overall market. If you include reinvested dividends their TTM Total return has been a measly 2.98%. I expect the price to climb throughout 2022 to increase returns.   

Visa's **Yield on Cost** has been increasing over the last ten years. Visa's YOC after 10Ys sits around 5.21% which is decent for income investors. Additionally, Visa's Dividend per Share CAGR sits around 17%, meaning that Visa increases their dividends on average by 17% per year. These are great numbers for dividend growth investors as well.     

**Dividend Payout Ratio**  

Lastly, Visa's dividend payout ratio sits around 22.23% with an average around 20%. This is significantly lower than most dividend companies including some long-standing dividend aristocrats. Visa is only paying around 22% of its earnings out as dividends meaning they have money available to continue funding further expansion in the future.   

**Conclusion**  

Visa has been hit hard in 2021. I was concerned with Visa as it is my second worst performing position of 2021. I believe Visa's stock price is on the road to recovery during 2022. It hit a low around the first of December at $189.91. I expect their earnings to continue to increase and the share price to follow when we receive Visa's Q4 2022 financial statements. Expect resistance around the 200-day moving average at $225-$228.     

In my opinion Visa is a **BUY** at current value. Its' dividend might be small, but it will increase quickly as long as the maintain their CAGR. Additionally, I expect price appreciation throughout 2022.      

Happy Investing!"
628,2021-12-28 08:43:55,"A random walkBurton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton University and writer of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, performed a test where his students were given a hypothetical stock that was initially worth fifty dollars. The closing stock price for each day was determined by a coin flip. If the result was heads, the price would close a half point higher, but if the result was tails, it would close a half point lower. Thus, each time, the price had a fifty-fifty chance of closing higher or lower than the previous day. Cycles or trends were determined from the tests. Malkiel then took the results in a chart and graph form to a chartist, a person who ""seeks to predict future movements by seeking to interpret past patterns on the assumption that 'history tends to repeat itself'"".
The chartist told Malkiel that they needed to immediately buy the stock. Since the coin flips were random, the fictitious stock had no overall trend. Malkiel argued that this indicates that the market and stocks could be just as random as flipping a coin.

Conclusion: stocks always will go uphill"
629,2021-12-28 07:39:14,"JPMorgan Says Investors Are Too Bearish, No Selloff In SightThere’s little reason to fear that the rally that catapulted U.S. stocks to successive records this year will end soon, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists. In fact, it may get broader. “Conditions for a large selloff are not in place right now given already low investor positioning, record buybacks, limited systematic amplifiers, and positive January seasonals,” the strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients. “Investor positioning is too bearish -- the market has taken the hawkish central bank and bearish omicron narratives too far.” 

While the S&P 500 climbed toward yet another record on Monday, the rally has recently been driven by a narrow group of mega-cap companies, which is reminiscent of the bubble in tech stocks at the turn of the century. With the economic rebound following the pandemic-induced slump now past its peak, some fund managers have warned that the next stage in the cycle is a correction, as central banks and governments wind down stimulus measures to tame surging inflation.

The bullish outlook echoes the one of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists, who also said earlier this month that the narrowing rally doesn’t point to an imminent major drawdown. “Rising concentration is not a reliable indicator for market peaks,” JPMorgan strategists said. “The largest S&P 500 companies currently have proven track record of delivering organic growth, higher pricing power, and superior capital return.”

I want to hold for long term but if it were to sink to $220 or something next year I'd rather sell now and buy back in at $220 a share obviously since there's no tax implication.

Of course some think it could sink below $200 also.  So obviously I could take my profits and buy even more shares at a lower entry price.

I do have 20% cash right now but that doesn't negate the fact that I would be better off selling current shares at $309 and buying back in at $220 or $190.

I'm not really looking to add any shares of these particular companies in the next 30 days, so that wouldn't really be a factor.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/21/tom-lee-the-strategist-who-has-correctly-guided-through-the-pandemic-sees-more-gains-next-year.html

Gene Munster:

""Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster warned investors to ""brace yourself"" for a potential correction in Big Tech during the first three months of 2022, as the market comes to terms with the likelihood that higher interest rates will force valuations to contract.""

However, Munster specifically highlighted high valuations for names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Munster quickly added that he believes in the long-term value of Big Tech but that earnings and revenue growth in 2022 will not be enough for most companies to overcome the contracting valuations that traditionally come with rising interest rates.

Tom Lee:

""“For next year, I think it’s going to be treacherous. I think it’s going to be a much tougher year than 2021, and one of the reasons is you have the midterm elections,” said Lee, in a telephone interview. “You’ve got the Fed raising rates and liftoff, and it looks like it’s going to happen before the middle of the year, and you still have the lingering issues of the supply chain and inflation and Covid. “I think it’s easily flat or down in the first half.

649,2021-12-27 22:36:47,"CDC Updates and Shortens Recommended Isolation and Quarantine Period for General Population>Given what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to 5 days, if asymptomatic, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others. The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after. Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others.
>
>Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for those exposed to COVID-19. For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than 2 months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for 5 days followed by strict mask use for an additional 5 days. Alternatively, if a 5-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure.  For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day 5 after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.
>
>Isolation relates to behavior after a confirmed infection. Isolation for 5 days followed by wearing a well-fitting mask will minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others. Quarantine refers to the time following exposure to the virus or close contact with someone known to have COVID-19. Both updates come as the Omicron variant continues to spread throughout the U.S. and reflects the current science on when and for how long a person is maximally infectious.
>
>Data from South Africa and the United Kingdom demonstrate that vaccine effectiveness against infection for two doses of an mRNA vaccine is approximately 35%. A COVID-19 vaccine booster dose restores vaccine effectiveness against infection to 75%. COVID-19 vaccination decreases the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. CDC strongly encourages COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 5 and older and boosters for everyone 16 and older. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on our communities.
>
>The following is attributable to CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky:
>
>“The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society. CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses. These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives. Prevention is our best option: get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.”

*The following was written on the*[ *recap I wrote December 3*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r8as26/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_december/)*: “On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying. As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.”* 

*During that time, there was so much fear-mongering and doomsaying going around on social media and even mainstream media. All those articles, understandably, caused a lot of panic, especially among newer retail investors. The stock market will always be dominated by cycles or rallies and pullbacks and always overreacts, to the upside and downside. The most important thing when playing the market is managing one’s emotions. Always stay calm, be flexible and be prepared to act if your thesis is proven wrong.  Do your own research and never pay attention to mainstream financial media like CNBC.* 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 27, 2021**

Remarkably, the S&P 500 (SPY) hit a new all-time high for the 68th time this year, driven higher by a rally in technology stocks, a very strong start for the bullish end-of-year rally typically called the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) is up more than 4% in the last five trading sessions alone. I for one am absolutely loving it.

On Monday, market participants cheered on a new report that showed retail sales in the US soaring past analyst estimates and a new report suggesting that Omicron, while more contagious, is much less severe than previous variants and less likely to cause hospitalization.

* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.41%

A report by Mastercard (MA) showed total US retail sales jumped a remarkable 8.5% from November 1 to December 24 thanks to soaring eCommerce sales. This is very encouraging as we continue to deal with supply-chain disruptions and elevated prices. eCommerce sales jumped up 11% this holiday season while sales at physical stores rose 8.1%, according to the same report.

According to three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains.

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, [according to data ](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

Dr. David Katz, President of True Health Initiative, said “One of the ways pandemics end is significant mutation of the virus. It looks like Omicron may be our friend in that regard, significant mutations different enough from the parent that it doesn’t make people as sick.” 

The market will head into 2022 with several key considerations to weigh but with its biggest focus on the course of the pandemic and rising inflationary pressures as well as the measures the Federal Reserve could take in response.

653,2021-12-27 21:36:33,"Opinions on LQD positionI started investing after the 1st covid market crash buying the dip. I didn't have any experience with stocks so I did a bit of reading and went mostly with QQQ and VOO which turned out to work really well for me. I was reading about diversifying to mitigate crashes with stocks so I went with some LQD and US treasury bonds as it's bonds and it's supposed to offer protection for stock market crashes. Also LQD provides a bit of yield (2.3%).

After 1.5+ year, I've already sold the US treasury bonds as they under performed and didn't give much yield and invested in SCHD instead. I'm thinking of doing the same with LQD. I bought some shares originally and I'm down a bit of money but the yield probably covered the lost already so it isn't a big deal in itself but it's a missed opportunity if you compare with something like SCHD (+25% YoY and 3% yield). Moreover LQD doesn't really seem to protect against market crashes, looking at its historical performance, it pretty much crashed the same as the S&P500 during the covid market crash for example, but didn't recover post crash...

Is there something I'm missing about LQD and bonds in general? Should I keep holding it or sell and buy something else instead?"

661,2021-12-27 17:43:19,"Amazon Stock: Why It's Cowen & Co.'s Top Mega-Cap Pick for 2022So far, the 2021 holiday season has not been the catalyst Amazon  (AMZN) - Get [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Inc. Report stock needed to rebuild momentum. Shares closed at $3,421 last Thursday (December 23), around 4% less than their trading price 30 days earlier. That is unimpressive, and AMZN's total performance year-to-date is less than 5% — even after the ""mini rally"" of the past few days. The market may be skeptical about the e-commerce titan. 

But Wall Street’s top analysts are heavily bullish on its stock. This time it’s Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge, who raised his target price for Amazon from $4,300 to an astonishing $4,500 — a 32% upside. Let's dive into his thesis. According to Mr. Blackledge, the online retail industry should start accelerating by the second quarter of 2022. This should push Amazon’s sales higher — Cowen & Co. estimates gross merchandise value to grow 16% year over year. In the meantime, the analyst also believes Amazon will improve its e-commerce margins, which should send price shares higher.

The firm’s higher-than-average valuation for Amazon is also supported by its above-consensus projections: Cowen & Co. raised both its back-half 2022 numbers and long-term figures. Blackledge is betting that Amazon’s 2022 revenue will grow 1% above consensus estimates, as well as pulling in 6% higher operating income and 10% higher earnings per share. “With Amazon shares trading at 18 times \[earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\], it is slightly below the midpoint of its historical range,"" Blackledge wrote.

""\[W\]e think, with the improving fundamentals, AWS and advertising will be robust again next year, \[so\] we could get multiple expansion, and that’s why Amazon is our top mega-cap bet."" Blackledge also believes the market hasn't taken into account growth in the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising divisions. Since both segments are projected to keep expanding in the future, we could suddenly see Amazon's stock price correct from its 2021 lag.

Blackledge added that Amazon should not increase its operating expenses in 2022. He said the company already “invested so much” throughout 2021. In fact, the analyst is confident the company will start increasing profitability if it hikes up the price of Prime membership. Since 2018, Amazon has more than doubled its fulfillment network, bolstered its one-day/same-day delivery capabilities, and improved its Prime Video catalog. On the other hand, investors saw Amazon's margins take a hit in 2021, mostly due to higher labor costs and increased wages. As the company digests these extra operating expenses and moves away from 2020 comps, Blackledge is confident that Amazon's stock will finally regain its traction.

662,2021-12-27 17:19:50,"With negative real returns forecasted on US equities, how are you diversifying your portfolio in 2022?This sub is largely focuses on US stocks, and specifically large-cap US stocks which is understandable, but with some market analysts predicting this asset class will see negative real returns over the next several years perhaps we could discuss how we are planning to diversify our portfolios going into 2022?

https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/gmo-7-year-asset-class-forecast-november-2021/

I certainly share the view that large-cap US tech stocks seem very pricy here, and that index valuations may therefore suffer if tech valuations take a hit in 2022. Specifically names like AAPL, NVDA and TSLA which make up a large percentage of the major US indexes have seen rapid and unsustainable multiple expansion in recent years which I suspect could weigh on returns going forward...

I've personally been diversifying into EM stocks recently, (Asia & Russia) as well as selling down my positions in US large-caps for smaller names with more attractive valuations. That said, I'm still quite bullish on some large-cap tech names like AMZN and GOOG. How are you positioning your portfolio going into 2022? Specifically are there any asset classes, markets and stocks are you are expecting to outperform in 2022, or are there any that you're looking to avoid?

Could we please try to avoid the usual recommendation to buy and hold some major US index funds in this thread? We all know over long-periods you'll do fine with this strategy, but this this is a discussion for those who take a more active interest in their investment portfolios and wish to avoid short-term volatility and drawdowns."

2. Are you taxed for long term and short term capital gains separately or do they stack? In other words, if I lost $100 in long term gains, but gained $400 in short term gains, am I only taxed $300? or is that $100 basically useless loss and I'm still taxed in short term at $400?

This was one of the best times to start investing as the market had just sold off in late 2018. Since then I've made a good chunk of change but nothing to write home about. Just by trying to actively buy and sell. I realized that if I had instead put my monthly savings into AMD or TSLA every month instead I would have made 100x my current returns.

Yes everyone preaches diversification but that's to preserve capital not grow it quickly. 

Yes I realize it's impossible to predict 100%. If someone could they'd be the richest man on the planet. Even still, people made money off these stocks. They saw something I clearly didn't. Maybe they just got lucky with the crazy bull market we've had?"
670,2021-12-27 15:42:03,"Sticking with Block (Formerly Known as Square)I've bought Block (NYSE: SQ) about six months ago, and it is a lesson in diversification.  Fortunately, I have other holdings that have performed well during 2021.  As I go into 2022, I am now faced with deciding whether to hang onto my holdings.

Here is my thesis:

* First, and most importantly, Block is financially sound with an Altman-Z score of 6.01. It also has positive free cash flow.
* It's revenue growth has not disappointed for 2021, and my projections, even with using a supernormal growth adjustment, has it growing 30% per annum over the next five years.  Even with the most bearish case, it has a present value of $450 and a five-year future value of $900.
* The downturn in earnings for 2021 is disappointing for sure, but still remains positive, which is a requirement for inclusion in the S&P 500 index.  When that happens, most large-cap mutual funds will be turned into buyers of this stock.  I had to make some assumptions finding fair and future values for this one.  First, I am assuming that its SG&A margin will remain stable at 19%.  I am also assuming a low end P/E of 23.  With that, I have it pegged with a fair value of $176, and an average future value of $327 .
* Block continues to be free cash flow positive, though based on FCF models, it is trading above its fair present value.
* As I see it, at worst this company is worth $198 right now, and should be worth $490 in five years.  Time will tell.

The lesson one should take from this experience is that one should never pile up their investment into one stock.  Me?  I have about 20 individual holdings, plus some ETFs and mutual funds.

Have a great new year."

I'm here to give you my year in review, to tell you what I've learned, my results and my desires for next year. It wasn't the first year where I said to myself ""well my saving account isn't great investment, I'll put my money somewhere else"". So I did some research in September 2020 to really start in January 2021.

I have to date :  
62 000$ on a saving account (to buy my home in 2022)  
24 000$ on a Trading 212  (lot of dividends stocks)  
7 500$ on an other saving account

So I created a Trading 212 account where I invested in different stocks up to 1000$ per month. On this Sunday evening at the end of December, I have +13,95% on my account.

I am very satisfied with this result, however I underperformed the market and when I see the results of typical ETFs (MSCI World / S&P 500 etc..), I say to myself that it would be wiser for me to turn to ETFs, to have better performances in the future.

Any advice on choosing an ETF? What do you think I could do better in 2022 ?

678,2021-12-27 11:59:06,"How often/when do you withdraw money from your portfolio?We all hear it over and over again that we should never disturb compounding. But say you invest majority of your earnings and simultaneously, you want to live on it as a form of ''passive income'' (I hate that word, but for the lack of a better term).

Say you have the mental resilience to handle volatility of the market, and on average, you know that you're going to do fine long-term. What are some strategies to make adequate withdrawals from your portfolio to pay for the ABCs of life without sacrificing the compounding?

For instance, here is a  excerpt from Peter Lynch's book where he goes over this concept.

[https://i.postimg.cc/0NzGXs6G/lynch.png](https://i.postimg.cc/0NzGXs6G/lynch.png)

My problem is that I sometimes fear making withdrawals from my portfolio. I think that everything should be set in stone and that I cannot by any means ''disturb the compounding''. But at the same time, I know that it would be a wise decision sometimes."

&#x200B;

I had a question regarding the sale of stocks at the year end. My country allows a 'tax free' capital gains allowance for 800$ per year. Meaning, I can sell without paying taxes for this much amount only. I currently have a small portfolio worth 10k and am up currently 1.5k on it. Would it be sensible to sell the stocks of which the profits accumulated at around 800$? I will then immediately buy back the same stock, but at a higher current price. This will secure me 800$ of tax free profits. Is it even worth it in the long haul? I currently pool in around 500$ monthly."

683,2021-12-27 09:38:16,"Margin Interest RatesI have been scouring the margin handbook for TD ameritrade and have more questions than answers. I have looked at past reddit posts and have not found answers yet.

How and when is margin interest rate charged?

All  I found in the handbook was that for a margin account, interest accrues and is paid once the stock position is sold...

So this is how I understand margin - I have 100,000$ cash and 200,000$ stock buying power in my margin account. Say I buy 80,000$ worth of stock which uses 40,000$ cash and 80,000$ stock buying power, which has me borrow 40,000$. Pretend I hold this for a full year with TDA's 9.0% interest rate. Then I proceed to sell for a 0$ gain as the stock traded sideways and just broke even. Am I charged (40,000 \* 0.09) = 3,600$ for holding this stock position thus only receiving 36,400$ back? Or more as the amount is compounded daily? 

OR...

Is interest only charged on ""Day Trade Buying Power"" that I hold over night once ""Stock buying power"" is depleted? For example, Day Trade BP might be 400,000$ while Stock BP is 200,000$. If I day trade 300,000$, am I charged interest on just the 100,000$  that is beyond my ""stock buying power""?

Clarification would be helpful

I will also ask customer service in the morning..."

I want to just get my feet wet in some financial sector stocks because I do not own any. I am really torn between these 3 options when it comes to where to start with the finance sector.

I use Visa everyday and V has been a consistent stock for along time which is attractive. As far as a long term “safe” bet Visa seems like a solid option for the start of my diversification.


PayPal is a name I hear thrown around all the time on these subreddits however I do not understand the hype. Now I am not a person that spends a ton of time diving deep into companies which is where I could be missing something but I do not see Venmo being added as a payment option on Amazon being a game changer for PayPal. For me personally, why would I use Venmo on Amazon when I can just use my VISA credit or Debit Cards? Again, I am not very educated about PayPal as a company so I invite someone to tell me why my belief is wrong. 

SoFi is the company I just used to refinance my student loans. I do not know much about them aside from their seamless refinancing system and having the best interest rate (for me at least) out of the other companies in loan refinancing. This is the only thing I know about SoFi. If I go with SoFi, why pick them over Visa or PayPal?"

689,2021-12-27 02:32:55,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR): What's it worth? ""Warren B"" AnalysisHappy Holidays Friends! Here's my analysis on one of the most discussed and misunderstood companies over the last year. As one of the [Paypal Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia)'s creations, Palantir Technologies (""Palantir"", ""PLTR"" or the ""Company"") originated from fighting fraud at Paypal using in-house analytical tools and human analysts to interpret big data. Paypal Mafia companies have performed well to say the least, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Yelp, YouTube, and others. Hopefully this post will help you determine whether you think PLTR will end up in the same conversation.

**Company Overview**

Palantir Technologies, Inc. builds software platforms for institutions. The Company operates through two segments, Commercial and Government. The Company has built two software platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry. The Gotham software platform is constructed for analysts at defense and intelligences agencies. It enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps the United States and allied military personnel. The Foundry software platform creates a central operating system for organization’s data where individual users can integrate and analyze the data. 

*Palantir analyzes big data and uses software to gather and process information that can identify connections, patterns, and trends. The main purpose is for organizations to make better decisions.*

[Summary of software platforms](https://imgur.com/a/EITlahN)

[Go-To-Market Strategy & Select Customers](https://imgur.com/a/PBbxckm)

[Financial Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/T4OqJgH)

**Key Management**

Alexander Karp, CEO/Co-Founder

Peter Thiel, Chairman/Co-Founder

Stephen Cohen, President/Co-Founder

Shyam Sankar, COO

**History**

* Paypal dealt with credit card fraud and created software to identify suspicious activity on their platform
* Peter Thiel challenged Alexander Karp and Stephen Cohen to engineer a system to identify terrorist networks and financial fraud
* The Company believes their software can stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in financial markets, etc.
* In 2020, Palantir went public via a direct listing at a $16.0B valuation
* The Company plans to continue its growth domestically and internationally, but also across segments into the commercial space

**Total Addressable Market**

Palantir believes its total addressable market (TAM) to be approximately $119.0B, accounting for all countries and companies where it is willing to sell its software. This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers ($56B, 6,000 commercial companies with over $500MM in revenue) and Government agencies that align with liberal democracies ($63B)

**Preliminary Risks**

* Security risks related to Government customers and information leaks that could damage the Company’s reputation
* Customer concentrations: The top 20 customers represented 61% of 2020 revenue; The top 3 customers accounted for 25% of 2020 revenue. Existing customers account for a large portion of revenue and therefore any termination of contracts may have a substantial impact on revenue
* AI and Big Data are relatively new industries with intense competition
* Customer contract terms and agreements. The majority of contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time
* Potential decline in US or other Government budgets, spending, priorities that may cause delays or unrealized value of customer contracts
* High revenue growth trajectory may be unsustainable given sales efforts and seasonality in projects or budgets

**Q3 Results & Commentary**

* Revenue increased by $102.8 million, or 36%, for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020
* Revenue from Government increased by 34% and Commercial increased by 37% from Q3 2020
* Cost of Revenue decreased by 42% for Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020
* Sales & Marketing expenses decreased by 54% and R&D expenses decreased by 70% from Q3 2020
* Palantir continues to see high growth, expecting 30%+ revenue growth for 2021 and the next four years through 2025

**Income Statement Projections / Assumptions** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/rFsBecz)

* Sales: 30-40% growth per year 2021E - 2024E, 10-20% growth per year 2025E - 2030E

*Additional Commentary:*

1. Conservative estimates based on the Company’s 2021 Revenue Guidance of 30%+ through the next four years
2. Average customer revenue was $7.9MM in 2020 and $7.0MM in LTM 9/30/21 Palantir benefited from increases in Government budgeting and spending, and growth in commercial customers
3. Covid-19 resulted in more contracts in healthcare, including a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

* Gross Margin: 77.5% - 82.0% as a % of Sales 2021 - 2030
* EBITDA Margin: Expansion from (28.4%) - 52.8% as a % of Sales  2021 - 2030
* Depreciation & Amortization: In line with historicals
* Interest Expense and Other: Palantir paid down its debt in 2021

**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/3LEjm6t)

PLTR doesn’t have any debt as of 9/30/2021

* Estimated Equity Value based on 9/30/2021 10-Q Balance Sheet
* Weighted Average Cost of Capital based on conservative estimates for cost of equity given the uncertainty of cash flows and industry risks
* Cost of Equity: 10.0%
* Terminal Value Growth Rate: 3.0% based on US GDP estimates
* Enterprise Value: $30,130.7MM
* Equity Value: $32,613.8MM
* Share Outstanding (in millions): 1,906.59
* ANALYST ”Street”  CONSENSUS ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE: $25.00
* BASE CASE ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE:  **$17.11** 

**Outlook & Final Thoughts**

Based on these growth expectations and dilutive effects of stock based compensation, Palantir is **slightly overvalued/fairly valued** at **$18.93 as of 12/23/21 close**. This may change  in the future given the variance in the Company’s cash flows, growth prospects, research & development, new products, average revenue per customer, compensation structures, and overall industry growth. 

I personally like PLTR as a long term portfolio hold because of **two main reasons**. First, I believe in **Alexander Karp as a founder and his vision**. You can see his passion for the company and its product. Palantir doesn't have a sales team and solely relies on developing world-class products to attract customers. Secondly, the **total addressable market size is massive**. Although Palantir is a B2B model, I believe they can eventually compete with companies like that of salesforce or other enterprise platform systems. Lastly, I will add that the #1 risk to equity holders is the dilution of shareholders through stock based compensation; however, it is likely to diminish in future years and should be treated as an ""expense"" for acquiring talented employees. I'd recommend watching Alex Karp interviews and Palantir's YouTube videos for more information.

MP Materials stock surged earlier this month after the U.S. rare-earths miner reached a deal “to develop a fully integrated U.S. supply chain for rare-earth magnets” with General Motors . In the wake of the higher stock price, MP Materials director Randall Weisenburger bought up shares.

MP Materials (ticker: MP) announced Dec. 9 that it will supply rare-earth materials, alloy, and finished magnets for the motors of electric vehicles to GM (GM) “with a gradual production ramp that begins in 2023.” Planned vehicles under the deal include more than a dozen models, among them the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and Chevrolet Silverado EV.” MP Materials also said it would build the company’s first magnetics factory in Fort Worth, Texas, sourcing materials from MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, Calif., mine. MP Materials stock sports a year-to-date gain of 34%, compared with a 26% rise in the S&P 500 index.

Weisenburger paid $3.5 million on Dec. 15 for 86,901 MP Materials shares, a per-share average price of $40.10. Those shares now represent his total ownership of MP Materials stock, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A former chief financial officer of Omnicom Group (OMC), Weisenburger joined MP Materials’ board in 2020 when the company went public through a special-purpose acquisition company.

Weisenburger declined to comment on his stock purchase.

On Dec. 10, after the pact with GM was announced, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Glick increased his December 2022 price target on MP Materials stock to $52 from $45. Glick, who rates MP Materials at Overweight, ​​cited forecasts for higher rare-earth prices. MP Materials’ move into rare-earth magnets “could drive multiple expansion for the company,” he wrote in a research report."

I’ve been investing for a while in cry and I wanted to diversify my investments in other areas such a stocks.

After researching a bit, I’ve seen how stocks are less volatile and in fact more slow in terms of growth. 

So my question is: is it a good idea to invest on stocks when you don’t have hundreds of thousands to put it? Any recommendations?

What I mean with all this is that if I want to put my money to work for me, and make some passive incomes. Stocks, for the middle class average man, doesn’t seem as profitable as cry.

Thank you and have a nice day"

I've read that in some cases the distinction on when the ex-dividend date is can really mark the difference on if the price increases or decreases, as more people who want to get in on the stock to recieve the dividend drives the price up, but then the selloff after the date upon the realization that it's now too late for the dividend warrants a decrease in price. My original question was actually on options, which was how dividends affect options; obviously it has to affect the underlying stock.

697,2021-12-26 23:50:14,"Despite supply issues and omicron, holiday sales rise 8.5%https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/26/despite-supply-issues-and-omicron-holiday-sales-rise-8point5percent.html

Holiday sales rose at the fastest pace in 17 years, even as shoppers grappled with higher prices, product shortages and a raging new Covid-19 variant in the last few weeks of the season, according to one spending measure. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks all kinds of payments including cash and debit cards, reported Sunday that holiday sales had risen 8.5% from a year earlier. Mastercard SpendingPulse had expected a 7.4% increase. The results, which covered Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, were fueled by purchases of clothing and jewelry.

Holiday sales were up 10.7% compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 holiday period. By category, clothing rose 47%, jewelry 32%, electronics 16%. Online sales were up 11% from a year ago and 61% from 2019. Department stores registered a 21% increase over 2020.

A broader picture will be revealed next month when the National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, comes out with its combined two-month results in mid-January. The results will be based on an analysis of the November and December sales figures from the Commerce Department. Analysts will also be dissecting the fourth-quarter financial results from different retailers that are slated to be released in February. Overall, analysts had expected a strong holiday season, fueled by early shopping that started back in October in anticipation of a product shortage. Consumers were also determined to celebrate the holidays after a muted one a year ago. Still, November saw a slowdown in retail sales, in part because of the early shopping. And omicron, which has fast become the dominant version of the virus in the United States, has now spoiled holiday plans for many Americans who have had to cancel gatherings last minute. The National Retail Federation said early in December that holiday sales were on track to beat its already record-breaking forecasts for an increase of 8.5% to 10.5% compared to the year-ago period. Holiday sales increased 8.2% in 2020 when shoppers, locked down during the early part of the pandemic, splurged on pajamas and home goods, mostly online.

The group expects that online and other non-store sales, which are included in the total, will increase between 11% and 15%. The numbers exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants. Holiday sales have averaged gains of 4.4% over the past five years, according to the group."

After a quick google search it sounds like it’s going to be an easy transition. I’m just curious what everyone in this sub has to say and if someone smarter than me could explain it a little better.
699,2021-12-26 23:22:17,"BABA, the PERFECT opportunityYes, you heard that right, BABA will be one of the top performers of the next 3 years and will have a phenomenal future. Here is why. 

First, let's start off with their basic financials and how stunning they are. I will be using seeking alpha, the financials they provide, and the growth estimates they provide. BABA is a 322 billion dollar Chinese company in e-commerce, financials, cloud, and much more. 

Revenue is 126,366,  a current P/S of 2.5. Rev is projected to grow 31.89% which is ridiculously large for their industry and compared to their previous YoY growth. This would bring them to a forward P/S of less than 2. This would be typical of car companies, not an commerce & cloud company with insane margins. 

Net income is 19.34 billion or an eps of 7.13, eps is projected to grow 10% next year but I believe this is a conservative estimate as revenue will grow by a much larger margin, eps declined YoY previously due to external factors while revenue still grew, and they brought in a new CFO who will increase margins, cut costs, and greatly increase eps. Anyways, assuming eps grows just 10% forward P/E is 15.12 on the high side essentially. Yahoo finance also gave me higher eps estimates but I'm using SA to be consistent. Additionally, their estimated CAGR for the next 3 years is 16% bring their forward PEG to be less than 1. 

Then, their net debt is -42,805 which is amazing because essentially they have no debt, cash on hand is over 71 billion dollars which is a HUGE cash pile for a company valued at just 325 billion. Shares outstanding have increased 6.5% over the past 3 years but they recently announced a 15 billion dollar buy back program that would reduce shares outstanding by 5%. 

Now, the last thing regrading their financials is that their FCF is actually 24 billion, much higher than their net income, and is going to grow at the same rate as EPS. Anyways, they are trading at a forward P/FCF of just 12. Once again, for a company growing at this fast of a rate, this is ridiculous. 

Now, everyone can agree that the financials are spectacular and the company would be vastly undervalued if we just judged it just on the financials. 

With BABA, the most important aspects to look at are their qualitative ones, not just regarding their business segments but particularly around the country they operate in, China, and the restrictions that could be imposed upon them. BABA has fallen over 61% from their highs for essentially two large reasons, delisting concerns about their shares and the Chinese government cracking down on some of their ""monopolistic"" practices by fining them a minor amount (2.8 billion) and delaying the IPO of ANT a financial company they have an extremely large stake in which includes services such as Alipay which is now also being separated from ANT. This is all bad news, but let me break it down into why it is simply an extremely large overreaction as all things are in the stock market and how it has presented an extraordinary opportunity, 

First, what most people consider to be the largest concern is the delisting of shares, one I frankly don't give two shits about. This concern has mostly stemmed from the delay of the ANT IPO and the delisting of DIDI shares, a fellow Chinese company. The important thing to note about this though, is that both DIDI and ANT had wanted to IPO in the year of 2021when China restricted them from doing so. ANT didn't go through, DIDI IPO'd but China soon fucked them by taking their app of stores then delisting them. These two scenario's don't worry me as once again China has never specially stated they wanted to delist BABA or any other Chinese company that was already public. Additionally, it makes virtually no sense for China to delist BABA as they gain virtually nothing because they just fuck over U.S investors making the U.S government mad, and the U.S would never delist BABA or it's Chinese counterparts because they would fuck over their own investors and worsen relations with China. Additionally, one report that dropped the stock significantly was that the SEC 3 years from now, in 2025, would require U.S regulators to audit BABA and if they did not comply then they would get delisted. 

The glaring thing about this is that it will occur 3 years from now and they would only get delisted if they do not comply, most likely, they will comply and everything would be fine. Lastly, regarding delisting, I simply do not give two shits if they do get delisted. What happens? Oh I have a good brokerage (Schwab) and my shares will get converted to Honk Kong Shares. The downsides, it will take a few weeks for me to get my money when I sell, and their is ""less money"" to flow into the stock. I think that if they got delisted to Hong Kong it could actually be a good thing as we then wouldn't have to worry about delisting concerns for those shares and they could move according to the businesses fundamentals. 

China won't enforce additional large regulatory crackdowns on BABA as first, they have already wiped off trillions in market cap for Chinese companies, worsened relations with the U.S, GDP growth has slightly slowed, jobs created have slowed, and XI's ""election"" has passed. All of these lead me to believe the Chinese government will slow down or stop with their Communist bull shit and start helping their domestic businesses again or stop hurting them. 

Now, the last concern that I didn't address because I frankly believe it is so overblown it may not even be worth it is that of the VIE structure. I believe that people who pin the fall on the VIE structure or use that as a reason to not invest are frankly full of it. BABA has always contained the VIE structure, as have essentially all other Chinese companies (JD), and some other foreign companies (RDS.A). Yes, with the VIE structure I theoretically own nothing, just a shell company in the caymans, but why is this a concern as of now? There are numerous ADR's that have been public for numerous years but now because of a few regulatory crackdowns where they will prohibit the listing of future companies with VIE structures, (not current ones), I simply see no reason to panic. Additionally, I don't see many smart people worrying about this, in Everything Money's recent interview with Monish Pabrai, they asked one of Pabrai funds analysts what they thought about BABA's VIE structure and they said that they just don't care. It's also important to note that BABA is one of the stocks that is most bought my hedge funds, and there are numerous famous investors that own it (Munger, Dalio) for example. 

Lastly, due to all of these factors I believe BABA will significantly outperform the S&P 500 over the upcoming years and this will be viewed as a great time to buy. I also didn't mention about 50% of my bull thesis on this stock because this post was getting a bit too long.

 I recently read the Dhandho investor and one of the popular philosophies they upheld throughout this book was Heads I win, Tails I don't lose much, and I believe this perfectly represents that opportunity.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 27th, 2021.

# **It looks like Santa Claus is on his way to stock investors in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/23/santa-claus-may-be-on-his-way-to-stock-investors-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After a period of turbulence, the decks may be cleared for a good old-fashioned Santa Claus rally in the week ahead.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, after a rough stretch that continued into Monday. The S&P 500 recovered and is up about 3.5% for December as of Thursday.
*****
> “I think all the things we’ve been concerned about for the month of December to a certain extent, are in the rearview mirror,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We know what the [Federal Reserve] is going to do. We know while this new variant spreads faster, it’s not as dangerous, and we know Build Back Better legislation is now 2022′s business... I think the market can find a path of least resistance to the upside as we wrap things up.”
*****
> The market has a lot of history on its side that trading days before the year-end are positive for stocks. According to the “Stock Trader’s Almanac,” the Santa Claus rally period — the final five trading days of the current year and first two of the new year — is mostly a time when the stock market gains. The S&P 500 has been positive nearly 79% of the time on those days since 1928 and has gained an average of about 1.7% per rally.
*****
> Add to that the fact that when the market has had a strong year, the momentum historically has carried into the final trading sessions. In that regard, the S&P 500 is up about 25% for the year.
*****
> According to Bank of America, when the S&P 500 has already seen such solid gains, the final six sessions are positive. Since 1980, there have been 10 instances where the S&P 500 was up 20% or more going into the last stretch of trading and in nine of those years, it ended the final six days higher.
*****
> # A notably rocky December
> Stocks head into the final sessions of the year with a tailwind, after several weeks of choppiness.
*****
> “This has been the fourth rockiest December since 1987. The average daily move for the S&P 500 has been 1.1%,” said Hogan. “That’s a lot of action.” The most volatile Decembers were in 2000, 2008 and 2018.
*****
> Hogan said volume in the last week of the year is typically 20% to 30% lower than normal. “In a low-volume environment, when the market picks a direction, it tends to move in that direction in a robust fashion,” he said.
*****
> Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said positive news on the Covid omicron variant this week was the catalyst that reversed the market’s sell-off. There were studies showing omicron to be milder than other variants of the coronavirus. Further, the Food and Drug Administration approved pills from Pfizer and Merck for the treatment of Covid-19.
*****
> “Whereas the market was focusing on everything that could go wrong since Thanksgiving, people are now just taking a sunnier view,” Hickey said. He expects that view will likely prevail in the coming week.
*****
> “As we get toward the beginning of January, we’ll see how markets are positioning themselves,” Hickey said. He said investors will start to turn their attention toward the upcoming earnings season; they do not seem to be overly optimistic, which could spell some upside surprises.
*****
> “Going into the last earnings season, there was a ton of negative sentiment based on supply chains, inflation and labor shortages. We ended up having a decent earnings season. It’s more mixed this time,” Hickey said.
*****
> # High-growth stocks hit
> The selling in November and December dented stocks. Some high-growth stocks and ETFs were down sharply as investors moved into safety plays. Funds that took their lumps in December include the Ark Innovation ETF and iShares Expanded Tech Software Sector ETF.
*****
> “I think some of these growth areas that have gotten hit hard will do a little better. They could see a bounce early in the year,” Hickey said. “They sold off for a number of reasons. One was concerns over the Fed. Also people had made so much money, and the feeling was taxes are going up. People were selling stocks ahead of higher taxes. That’s more of a question now with a divided Congress.”
*****
> In the past week, the fate of President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better stimulus legislation was put in doubt when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he would not support it. Analysts expect to see further versions of the spending plan.
*****
> Bespoke’s Hickey said January could be positive for stocks, and with opportunities for some stocks to bounce if stung by tax-loss selling. “The January effect is a positive. All those tax-loss sellers that compressed multiples are buyers,” he said.
*****
> One of the stocks he’s watching is Boeing. “It’s one of the few big cap stocks that was down a lot. I think you can see that,” he said. The airplane maker has gained more than 6% in the past week, but it’s still down 16% over the past six months.
*****
> # Rate hikes and housing data
With the Fed forecasting three interest rate hikes for next year, economic data of all sorts is front and center for the markets.
*****
> The housing market has been a huge beneficiary of the near-zero rate policy, so all data on housing will be closely watched. On Tuesday, home prices data will be released. Pending home sales are to be reported Wednesday.
*****
> David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX, said the next big data point for the market will be December jobs in early January. He expects markets to be relatively quiet next week.
*****
> “Next week is generally a snoozer, the week before New Year’s,” he said. “All the action’s going to come in the first week in January.”

> # Do You Believe In The Santa Claus Rally?

> “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” —Yale Hirsh

> December is widely known as one of the best months of the year for stocks, but most don’t realize that the majority of the gains happen in the second half of the month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chart-12.22.21.jpg?ssl=1))**

> Equity strength at this time of the year is widely known as the Santa Claus Rally, but the term is somewhat misunderstood. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real Santa Claus Rally is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official Santa Claus Rally is set to begin Monday, December 27. Fun trivia this is the latest any Santa Claus Rally can start and latest it has started in 11 years.

> So how likely are these seven trading days to be higher? Well, there isn’t a single seven-day combo out of the full year that is more likely to be higher than the 78.9% of the time higher we’ve seen previously during the Santa Claus Rally. Additionally, these seven days are up an average of 1.33%, which is the third-best seven-day combo of the year. Do you believe yet?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.22.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking a bigger picture view, here is the win rate of any single day. We are in the middle of an incredible 11 day streak with each day having a greater than 50% chance of being higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.22.21-3.jpg?ssl=1))**

> “Why are these seven days so strong?” asked LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Whether optimism over a coming new year, holiday spending, traders on vacation, institutions squaring up their books—or the holiday spirit—the bottom line is that bulls tend to believe in Santa.”

> The LPL Chart of the Day illustrates how the Santa Claus Rally has performed since 2000. Usually these seven days are higher, which leads to strength in January and beyond. But what stands out to us is that the times Santa didn’t come, January was lower each time. Now do you believe?

> Let’s take a closer look at what happens when things don’t go according to plan. Remember, Yale Hirsch told us, “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” This is because the New York Stock Exchange is at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets.

> Going back to the mid-1990s, there have been only six times Santa failed to show in December. January was lower five of those six times, and the full year had a solid gain only once (in 2016, but a mini-bear market early in the year). “Considering the bear markets of 2000 and 2008 both took place after one of the rare instances that Santa failed to show makes believers out of us. Should this seasonally strong period miss the mark, it could be a warning sign,” explained Santa Claus believer Detrick.

> # NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Most Bullish Day After Christmas

> This year the day after Christmas is also the beginning of the Santa Claus Rally. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanac as the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

> It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

> Since 1988, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have enjoyed the greatest frequency of gains and average gain on the day after Christmas. NASDAQ has advanced 72.7% of the time with an average move of +0.39%. Small-caps have also advanced 72.7% of the time with an average advance of +0.39%. DJIA and S&P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish nonetheless. Two days after Christmas, the market remains bullish however, the frequency and magnitude of gains does ease with NASDAQ bringing up the rear.

> # S&P 500 Performance Around Christmas

> With Christmas just two days away and markets closed tomorrow, many investors are on the watch for a 'Santa Claus' rally. In all periods in the post-WWII era, the average S&P 500 performance in the week leading up to Christmas is a gain of 0.5% with positive returns just over two-thirds of the time. The average performance in the week after Christmas is slightly higher at 0.7%, but the consistency of positive returns is the same. This year, the S&P 500 has performed considerably better than its pre-Christmas average gaining 2.25% through midday Thursday. Since 1945, the S&P 500 has traded up more than 1% in the week leading up to Christmas 23 times (30.3%), and in those prior 23 years, the average week after Christmas performance was actually a bit weaker than normal with an average gain of 0.3% and positive returns just over 60% of the time. That compares to an average gain of 0.7% in the same week for all years since 1945.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Avg-perf-based-on-week-before-xmas-122021-3.png))**

> The table below lists each year since 1945 that the S&P 500 was up over 1% in the week leading up to Christmas along with how it performed in the final week of the year. Of those 23 prior years, there were actually 14 where the S&P 500 rallied 2% or more in the week leading up to Christmas with the last occurrence seven years ago back in 2014. While those types of gains may have put investors in a good mood for the Christmas holiday, it didn't leave much powder left for the last week of the year as the median gain was just 0.05% with positive returns half of the time.

> # Best and Worst Performers Since Thanksgiving

> Although the Russell 1000 is now pretty much right back in line with its pre-Thanksgiving level, certain stocks have seen dramatic moves during that same span. Of the 25 stocks that have experienced the largest gains since 11/25, 19 were down on the year leading up to Thanksgiving, and the average stock had declined by 20.0%. Since then, those 25 stocks have gained an average of 13.1%, with Smartsheet (SMAR) and Chegg (CHGG) leading the group with gains of 22.2% and 20.4%, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Best-perf-since-122221-2.png))**

> Of the Russell 1000 members that have performed the worst since Thanksgiving, their average YTD performance leading up to Thanksgiving was a gain of 85.7% while the median performance was much less but still an impressive +25.6%. Of these 25 stocks, 18 were positive YTD through Thanksgiving, and the average decline since then is 23.6%. Everbridge (EVBG) and DocuSign (DOCU) topped this list with declines of 37.2% and 36.6% since Thanksgiving, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Worst-perf-since-122221.png))**

> Based on the data above, it appears as if there was some rotation in the Russell 1000 as investors shifted from leaders to laggards. Essentially, the worse a stock performed between the start of the year and Thanksgiving, the better it has performed since, at least for the top 25 movers to the upside. For the 25 stocks that have declined the most since Thanksgiving, there seems to be very little correlation between the size of the move to the upside before Thanksgiving and performance since then. In the charts below, GameStop (GME) Upstart (UPST) were omitted from the chart but included in the R squared calculation due to visual distortion.

> # December Volatility Spike

> December typically tends to be a month of lower stock market volatility following a period in late October and early November when volatility tends to peak. This year, however, has been quite different. As of yesterday's close, the one-month rolling average of one-day absolute moves for the S&P 500 was 1.06%. (This means the S&P 500 has been averaging a daily change of +/-1%+ over the last month.) As shown in the dark blue line below, this has actually been the most volatile one-month period for all of 2021. As the light blue line shows, daily volatility for the S&P 500 is usually plummeting at this time of year as traders typically slow down dramatically around the holidays.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/rolling-vol-122121.png))**

> Since the 5-day trading week was established back in September 1952, December has historically been the least volatile month of the year, averaging an absolute daily change of 0.61%. This year, the average daily change since the start of December has been 1.07%, which is far above the next closest level seen in March 2021 (+/-0.83%). October, the month that has historically been the most volatile month of the year, ranked 6th in 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Avg-daily-chg-by-month-122121.png))**

> So what tends to occur when volatility inverses its seasonal trend in December? Since 1953, there have been five prior years where December was the most volatile month of the year: 1973, 1978, 1985, 1995, and 2018. Below we show how the S&P 500 performed in January following the five prior years listed, and we also show the full next-year change. As shown, January was positive in four of five instances, and the one January that saw a decline was in 1974 when it fell only 1%. In the most recent occurrence, the 9.2% decline in December of 2018 was followed by a 7.9% move higher in January of 2019. In the following year, the median performance of the S&P 500 was +14.6%.

> # Bears Still Outnumber Bulls Despite Rally

> The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, but recent sentiment readings are still relatively bearish. However, this isn't necessarily negative for markets, as it gives the opportunity for bears to shift their position, which would likely be accompanied by an increase in equity purchases. AAII's reading on bullish sentiment moved from 25.2% last week to 29.6% this week. This week's reading is still 6.7 percentage points below the average since 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-bullish-122321.png))**

> In turn, bearish sentiment dropped from 39.3% down to 33.9%, which is only 1.8 percentage points higher than the historical average level. This week's reading was also the second-largest week-over-week decline in bearish sentiment since September 9th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-bearish-122321.png))**

> Neutral sentiment ticked higher by 1.2 percentage points, resulting in 36.6% of respondents reporting a neutral view of the market. This is the lowest absolute change in a month and is 5.0 percentage points higher than the average level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-neutral-122321.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index moved higher this week alongside bullish sentiment. The index ranges from +200 (levered long) to -200 (levered short) and this week the index moved from 52.2 to 67.0, essentially erasing last week's significant drop. That indicates reporting investment managers' exposure to US equities is roughly 67%.

This week, the Dow finishes the year on a bullish note and enters 1922 poised for greatness. Global sentiment, however, remains tepid.

**Quick Stats:**

DJIA: 81.10 (Today: 35,951)

Shiller PE Ratio: 6.2 (Today: 39.7)

Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 4.5% (Today: 0.25%)

GBPUSD: $4.22 (Today: $1.34)

Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $4.00)

**Market-Moving Themes:**

Sentiment slowly turning positive as business activity improves and financial conditions ease (equity, debt markets)

Commodity prices normalizing after working through post-war adjustments (commodity markets)

The US dollar has emerged from World War I as a reserve currency, alongside the pound sterling (currency markets)

**Executive Summary:**

* Nothing material impacts the broad equity markets this week, but the overall tone is firm and cheerful. Optimism has started rearing its head more often in the FT and WSJ. The Dow ends the year +11% after surviving the worst deflationary recession in living memory.
* On Tuesday, the WSJ lays out a fantastic front page article discussing how Henry Ford dazzles audiences and shapes public opinion through a barrage of media appearances. He is not just a great businessman, but also a tastemaker. Ford owns the largest car company and largest Hollywood film studio, and wields both to brilliantly influence society.
* Historical Fact: Henry Ford and Elon Musk, while separated 100 years apart, personify the celebrity-businessman. There’s one thing, however, that Musk and Ford would disagree on: Tesla and SpaceX spend zero on marketing. Who knows what Ford would have done with Twitter!?
* Wall Street attention is now turning to the forthcoming Five-Power Economic Conference (US, UK, Japan, France, Italy) which is expected to take up exchange rate, debt funding, reparations, and other kindred problems. Significant uncertainty regarding the value of German assets hangs over markets; German debt, on average, lost 60% of face value, while the mark dropped 80% against the dollar during 1921.
* Wednesday’s FT headlines an article titled “Russians Revive,” which details Lenin’s plan to return confiscated property under his New Economic Policy. This “free market with state control” mandate revives dormant shares on the London Stock Exchange. In chaotic trading, speculators bought anything from Russo-Asiatic stock to Trans-Siberian Railway bonds. Other lesser known companies followed in sympathy, all surging 15-25%.
* Historical Fact: If this sounds funky, just wait 7 more years. In 1928, Stalin scraps Lenin’s NEP and dives head first into pure communism (known as the Great Break). Several of Stalin’s policies will remain until 1991 when the USSR dissolves.

717,2021-12-26 12:55:23,"Tesla = sTale : TSLA as a short play - BearishIf you look around there are so many Tesla’s on the road that we have reached visual saturation. Every time I see another one of those big Tesla bubble shapes or sedans I think when are we going to see a redesign ? It’s like eating the same thing for dinner every night for months. 

Tesla is, now, at its peak because it owned the EV market. However, it is clear that conditions will change dramatically and rapidly in the coming year when consumer choices are possible based on comparisons of a great variety of EV models. We have yet to see the coming competition in daily traffic. That day is coming for TSLA and with it a sharp stock decline. And I for one am looking forward to some visual variety in the EV sector.

I predict TSLA within the next 12-18 months will drop below $600 per share and that is a 46% decline in the stock price from Thursdays close and consequently a massive gain on medium term puts. 

In conclusion their is a high probability of a sharp decline in the shares which IMO will be very profitable. 

Good luck to all smart multidimensional traders !"

The stock is valued at 13.4B and selling at a forward P/E of only 3.39 (Analyst Prediction), with only 75.21M Shares. Having a much more accessible COVID vaccine by not having to be completely frozen, I think Novavax stands out in the ability to reach Third World countries and other markets that can't necessarily get their hands on others. It's also shorted quite a bit, due to the low amount of shares making it quite a easy stock to manipulate, overall though I think the upcoming Year looks bright for Novavax, especially with the Phase 3 trials of multiple vaccines in the works as we speak, and the COVID vaccine being the only protein based vaccine (As far as I know) on the market.

T (AT&T) seemed like the best one to go with, so I bought a few shares about 5 years ago.

The problem is... T has been sucking badly. Even with the high dividends my rate of return on T has practically been in the negative/breaking even throughout the years. They literally own a monopoly over our telecommunication industry and we've had one of the most massive bull market runs in history; how is it even possible for T to suck this badly?

Luckily, T is a very small percentage of my portfolio, which is mostly index funds and tech stocks, so I'm not even really worried about it. It's more of the fact that it blows my mind away how a company can suck this badly?"
723,2021-12-25 23:39:54,"""There Is No Alternative To Stocks"" is one reason why stocks are so high. Will it drop drastically after rate hike?One reason why stocks are at historic highs right now is that ""There is no alternative to stocks"" (or Tina). 

Conventional wisdom says this advantage will be gone once the fed raises rates. While this might be true, is it possible that the **reversal is not going to be as strong** as analysts believe due to behavior of new-to-market retail investors, who are:

* More likely to stick to ""story stocks"" -- and look beyond earnings, dividends, or PE ratios.

* Less interested in ""boring"" investments like bonds. 

* Less likely to put their money into buying a house, as the housing market is out of reach for many people in their 30s and 40s.

* Increasingly tribal and seems to identify their ownership of stocks like being a superfan of a sports team.

* Looking at ownership of certain meme stocks as a political or anti-establishment statement.

* More likely to believe the ARK narrative that in the long term tech is deflationary, and more likely to hold and ""buy the dip"".

Of course there will be some reversal, but how strong will it be given these factors?"

725,2021-12-25 22:11:08,"Leveraged ETFs?So something I never quite understood about leveraged ETFs. ETFs inherently are considered less risky than regular stocks due to their diversification, right? And with less risk theoretically comes less growth potential than regular stocks right? Since indexes as a whole have been almost always increasing, can't you just compensate the lack of growth potential by using a leveraged ETF?

728,2021-12-25 20:55:40,"What is this term called?I invested $200 in a coin. My investment is worth $340 right now.

I want to know if there is a term for cashing it all out now and reinvesting in the same coin? Is this called ‘reinvesting capital gains’?

EDIT: i want to do this
is this a viable strategy? I started with $200, I now have $340. I want to now invest $340 so that when my investment does well the multiplier is on the $340 instead of $200.

For example, if a coin doubles in value then I’m making only $400 ($200 x 2). But if it doubles when I invested $340 initially then my investment is worth $680.

Never thought it would hit /r/popular, very interesting perspectives, perfectly encapsulates the market conditon right now. I have decided to seek an advisor and listen what they recommend.

730,2021-12-25 20:08:50,"Do you sell out of positions every time a stock becomes overvalued or do you just hold?I have 5% positions in a lot of stocks I plan to hold for 10 to 20 years in names like UNH HD MSFT ASML GOOGL etc. Blue chips I call them.

I thought more or less we are taught to just hold and ""ride the waves"" up and down and add when things go lower (on sale maybe) and more or less never sell on good companies.

So I assume that the consensus is not to sell a position every time one of your stocks becomes ""overvalued""?

I mean id probably have to sell all my stocks if that were the case lol!

I mean I already have 20% cash for when some positions sell down if fed taper causes 20% or more correction next year or whatever.

I thought that the consensus was more ""time in the market instead of timing the market""?

For example I could say I'm selling all my long shares of MSFT cause I think they're overvalued and think they'll fall next year and then I sell and they continue up another 10%.

Isn't it better to instead to just hold my MSFT (for example) rather than sell and hope it goes cheaper to buy in lower?

Then if the market does tumble 40% next year buy more MSFT at a possible 40% discount?

Should I be jumping in and out of my positions every time a stock becomes ""overvalued"" or do you just have to use your own judgement?

Was looking at $CHPT on 23rd Dec and noticed that the IV Percentile was trading at the 11-12% range. Which is quite strange. (As it's really low for such a volatile counter).

Its prices have been moving sideways for the past 4-5 days and it's currently sitting on the lower bottom half of the Bollinger band.

RSI is also at 30+ only which means it's near the ""oversold"" area.

IV is not really low at 70+% but I found both IV Percentile and HV Percentile in the really low range.

Thus, I decided to buy 1 call option Expiring on 20th Jan 2023 @ a strike price of $18. (Already up 5% by closing).

I gave up on blue chips and started to make swing trades lost half of my portfolio. Decided to keep the blue chip stocks and just invest into s&p 500 index funds. Which made me money. After about 2 years I am at a point of break even. 

NOTE: My portfolio was about $4k. And now I regret not dollar cost averaging on my blue chip stocks

During this time I did some on and off research. And realized that if I start with $10k portfolio and aim for 5% daily and keep reinvesting the money I can end up with a million dollars in 96 days.

I wanted your thoughts on large banks/financials for the next 6-12 months+

I know financials have already moved up, but it feels like there is some more room to run until the Fed actually moves up rates and finishes taper. 

When rates moved up from 2004-2006 and 2016-2017, large banks did well. But stock markets were also strong, so it is hard to tell. 

I am not looking at smaller banks or regionals for this, trying to focus on larger banks such as BAC, JPM, C, WFC. 

Logically banks have more money to make on loans if rates are higher, but I assume their volume will be lower in terms of lending, especially if housing market slows down

Now, things have no changed with this pushed back date and I have a pretty sizable amount of cash on hand as I was expecting to need to be pretty liquid in a month or so. 

My question to you all is: how would you use this money to gain a little more repayment power in the four new additional months of investing time. In the grand scheme of things, this is not a lot of time.

Imagine an objective analysis 10 years in the future:

An objective analysis 10 years in the future will acknowledge that TESLA investors believed that it was reasonable to buy TESLA stock with a valuation of 100 or so times of forward earnings... and expected it to continue to climb in value ... despite all evidence that the ENTIRE global automotive sector was about to jump into EV production... ready to compete with TESLA for market share, some with subsidy support from their own governments. Those future analysts will be very, very puzzled and ask the question: ""What were they thinking?"" TESLA is, now, at its apex because it owned the EV market. However, it is clear that conditions will change dramatically and rapidly in the coming year when ACTUAL consumer choices are possible based on comparisons of a great variety of EV models. We have yet to see the coming competition in daily traffic. That day is coming for TESLA. Typical consumers are risk-averse and value-conscious. We all don't drive the very best and most expensive cars... we drive what we need at the best value. Competition in TESLA's space will be massive, brutal, and ugly. It is understandable that TESLA can only lose market share over time. There's evidence that this is NOW happening because of Ford's entry into EV production.

Ford is currently valued at just about 10 times of forward earnings. Ford is UNDER-VALUED with ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH. Those same future analysts ten years from now will ask quizically: ""How could a reasonable and well-informed investor back then choose TESLA over Ford? It was obvious that Ford was the much better value."""

749,2021-12-24 18:10:37,"Do stocks like PG make sense in an accumulators portfolio?To me I think of proctor and gamble more as a way to preserve already attained wealth.  To me that would be something like $50 to $100k i didn't want to risk much of and may still be some years from retirement.

If I was within maybe 5 years I'd maybe have even less than the $100k (for example) in something like a PG just to make up for inflation.

Anyways I'm wondering if someone like myself that's in accumulation mode should even have a stock like PG with any sizeable percentage.

I mean if I have 10 to 20 years till retirement, why not something like COST instead?  Or heck even MSFT performing poorly should give a better return than Proctor and Gamble.

Even things like JNJ.  Are those better suited to preserving already attained wealth?

I realize bonds were in the past, but now they don't yield that much.

Back in John Bogles days bonds could yield up to 10% with relatively low risk.

So I guess my main question is is it better to be mostly in growth type stocks if you have a long runway and not much of a portfolio?

Does holding 5% in Proctor and Gamble (one stock for example) do anything for someone sub 6 figures portfolio?

Or instead of a percentage in PG type stocks, wouldn't the sp500 index make more sense?"

The performance over the last 10 years is near identical, dividends are identical, the only difference I can really see is VOO is quite a bit newer and SPY has a bit higher of an expense ratio (0.03% for VOO, 0.0945% for SPY).

It it just because SPY has been the de facto standard for a while and VOO is still relatively new, or is there some fundamental benefit to going SPY over VOO? Or is it that the expense ratio is quite small either way and it doesn't make a noticeable difference?

756,2021-12-24 13:15:27,"Few ideas on why Burry bought LMT and how to invest in 2022Hello world

Few months ago I wrote a bearish post about ARKK investments and how green energy will be demolished. Turns out I was right or lucky, one of those. As an investor I am looking not only for fundamentals in companies, but products and political situation. 

We all know that Dr. Burry is bearish for a few years now. He is predicting a crash monthly, shorted TSLA many times and is dancing with his Twitter account like a mad man (for those of you who don't know, he deletes his account multiple times in a month, as well as his posts). 

In my view his selling is nothing of a surprise. He is doing what he is saying - most of the market up so he sells. But why did he buy $LMT? A military company that relies heavy on government contracts? Why is he bearish on China?

Well this is one of the biggest political questions of this decade. What is going to happen to Taiwan?

Turns out Burry believes there will be a military conflict. He doesn't say it out loud because it would make news and probably impact his image, but his investment in military entity regardless of current market conditions suggest he is preparing for escalation of conflict. 

As investors we should take stances with our money. For example in my case I believe there will be no military interaction between US and China thus I am a buyer of Chinese indexes right now. 

And this is what I think is going to happen next year and what I personally think is the safest way of proceeding with stocks. 

As a fundamental investor my approach to buying companies is simple - in Buffet words I ""own them like pieces of businesses"". I try to keep my investments for a long time and buy them as I would be buying a piece of a local bakery. 

I am not a bear and not a bull. I simply buy what's worth buying in my circle of competence. 

Turns out most of the bakeries around town are not producing enough bread to justify quotes for their businesses. 

But we won't face a big correction or a crash. 

Why? 

Because I believe we are in two stock markets right now. 

There is market of reason where we might find stocks with strong fundamentals, earnings growth and P/Es under 25, and P/Bs under 5. There are active investors in this buckets, they buy and sell using their knowledge and fundamentals. It's really really hard to do. 

There is a second market of pure speculation and extremeness. Meme stocks, bubbled up car companies etc. etc. This market will function as long as people won't pull the rug. 

The only questions how much impact one market has over the other. There won't be a 30% decline in the market of reason. But individual stocks can and will decline 30% and more. For example NVIDIA is a great company we can all agree, metaverse is a big topic right now but the company lost it's fundamentals because of the ever growing bullish public. As Buffet said ""a great company can be a terrible stock investment"". Beware of companies like that in 2022. For example I would love to buy McDonalds stock. But I can't. Valuation of my favourite fast food joint is getting more and more crazy and I can't stomach the valuation right now. Declining earnings, ever growing PE and stock price...I am a buyer for sure but not now, if the market drops 15-20% McDonalds would need to increase earnings and growth to make my loss back without even thinking of making a buck in this company right now.

S&P might fall 10-15-20%. Maybe it won't. But the question we all should ask ourselves ""how quickly my holdings can recover?"" Are the companies that you hold have enough cash flow to survive? Are they burdened with debt? Or they have healthy balance sheets and decline of 10% is only a buying opportunity? 

McDonalds won't be able to recover quickly and will be a buying opportunity if the market decides to bring it back to fundamental valuations.

Stock market will weigh all of these things next year and the following years as well. 

If you hold a company or a meme stock without cash flow, without real earnings and without real money customer to company, hard cash, you might hold your bags forever. 

I am incredibly interested what 2022 will bring us, I wish you all the best and good luck with your investments.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

From March on, Tencent will give out around 457 million Class A shares in JD.com as a special interim dividend, representing about 86.4% of its total stake and 14.7% of the online retailer’s total issued shares, according to a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday. At Wednesday’s close, that many shares were worth HK$127.7 billion ($16.4 billion).

Tencent, which controls about 17% of JD.com, will hold roughly 2.3% of the e-commerce company’s shares after the handout, JD.com said in a separate statement. As part of the deal, Tencent President Martin Lau will exit JD.com’s board effective Thursday.

765,2021-12-24 01:22:59,"Hypothetical: China begins invasion of Taiwan, does Intel stock go up or down?There are two schools of thought on this:

* Intel stock goes up because TSM's production is cut off, therefore greatly hampering fabless chip companies like AMD or NVDA.

* Intel stock goes down, because while Intel has American fabs, a lot of the components and packaging are still done in Asia so a war in that region will still lock down Intel's production. Plus TSM makes chips for Intel as well.

For purpose of this hypothetical, assume that the war is contained to just between China and Taiwan (e.g. United States is not sending troops and no one is talking about firing nooks or ICBMs in retaliation).

If your answer is ""Intel goes down"", then does it go down as much as AMD would?"

Shortly after and luckily for me, Tesla's CEO tweeted that he was (almost) done selling his 10% stake to pay taxes, or whatever bullshit that whole thing was. The stock surged on Wednesday so I decided to take my gains and sold my call for 2300$. At some point on Wednesday I even bought another call and sold it for a 15% profit at the same time as the first one.

On Thursday I then saw those calls rising to around 6000$ each, which got me quite frustrated obviously... ""wow if I had sold now I'd have made so much more money, I'm a dumbass... no i'm not, I took my gains and should be happy with that... blablabla"". Of course, nothing guarantees me that I'd have sold the calls for 6000$ on thursday, maybe I'd have taken my gains earlier or something.

Anyway, how do you guys deal with missing out on big gains for selling early? Usually it doesn't affect me, so much but in this case I can't get if off my mind because those would have been huge gains.

Just a 10k (well... 7k-15k, depending on the month!) portfolio, I've realized I really like selling callsBasically I decided to finally learn about investing by having ""some skin in the game."" I've made some, I've lost some, I've dabbled in options, nothing too crazy. Started of course by buying calls, then dabbled in selling calls and puts, and basically I feel really comfortable selling calls. My strike price is always a decent bit above my average cost, so if it gets assigned, then oh well, I'm forced to take some profit (and paid a little premium for it!) I try to sell calls when the stock is on a rise, and either let them expire or buy them back at 50%+, if I think I can sell another call soon. 

I feel like I'm missing what the downside of this strategy is? I kind of love it, and wish I had been doing this all along. I don't have the capital to sell puts but if I did, I think selling puts (and possibly having to buy stock at a discount, then selling calls on it) and calls would be pretty much exclusively what I do. 

I have about 600 shares of 23AndMe $ME, and though the stock hasn't soared, I'm till positive on it (*edit*: I think this isn't true haha. I'm about 18% down on commons, but I've made some back in selling calls, and got assigned on another couple hundred shares earlier at a profit, and feel pretty good about its future) and have taken quite a bit of premium just for holding the stock! $RKLB (only 104 shares) and Cleveland-Cliffs ($CLF), which I had a large position in, but did get assigned from a call (at a profit, so I'm not complaining?) And some various things, $MSFT, etc. But just thinking about stocks I can accumulate with my meager portfolio/income.

Any insight into downsides I'm missing, or tickers to look at, or if you want to educate me a little on what to look at with The Greeks, I would appreciate any of it! Thanks!"

GlobalFoundries Inc. (Nasdaq: GFS) (GF), a global leader in feature-rich semiconductor manufacturing, today announced that it has agreed to amend its Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with AMD to increase the volume of chips GF will supply as well as extend the terms of the agreement to secure supply through 2025. The agreement also expands the breadth of the partnership, including supply assurance for AMD chips serving the datacenter, personal computing, embedded and other growth markets. 

GF has been manufacturing high-performance chips for AMD for more than 12 years, and this new agreement extends this long-standing partnership to ensure supply for AMD's growing business. With this agreement, AMD now expects to purchase approximately $2.1 billion of wafers from GF between 2022 and 2025.

""We have been working closely with our customers for more than a year to help address the ongoing supply-demand imbalance in our industry,"" said Tom Caulfield, GF CEO. ""Our amended agreement with AMD is a prime example of our customers' desire and willingness to secure long-term supply. This agreement not only increases the volume of chips we will be producing for AMD, it also secures and extends their supply through 2025.""

The global demand for semiconductors is growing at an unprecedented rate, and GF is responding to this growth through a series of strategic long-term agreements with existing and new customers and simultaneously expanding global capacity to meet customer demand."

**Nasdaq: 15,653.37 (+131.48) (+0.85%)**

In time for the Holiday, the US markets cheered up with the S&P closing at a new record and shrugging off the worries that troubled in the beginning of the week. Fueled by optimism on the impeding Santa Claus rally next week the indices posted back-to-back sessions gains with most of the stocks in the green. The VIX continued to dip reflecting the market sentiment and closed at the lowest levels since the Thanksgiving weekend.

Tesla built upon the momentum of Musk’s closure of share sales and further buoyed by positive estimates of various analysts on the Q4 Tesla delivery numbers, jumped another 5% today to close at $1,067.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 23, 2021**

The stock market continued its positive momentum, with all three major indexes pushing higher for the third straight day to close out the holiday-shortened week as investors continue to digest a trove of new economic data, including a report on inflation, and the FDA approval of Pfizer (PFE) and Merck’s (MRK) coronavirus anti-viral pill. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.61%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.75%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.55%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.81%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.15%
* Tesla (TSLA): +5.81%
* Crocs (CROX): -11.93%

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose 5.7% in November, the fastest pace in over three decades. PCE price index rose 0.6% for the month, slightly lower than the 0.7% monthly gain in October. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.7%

Personal incomes rose 0.4% in November, slightly lower than a 0.5% increase in October. That followed a 1% plunge in September, when federal unemployment benefit expansion came to an end. 

Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% in November, a solid gain but below the 1.4% surge in October.

Kathy Bostjanic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics. said “Consumers spent with less enthusiasm in November as they shifted their holiday shopping to earlier in the season and continued to contend with escalating prices and reduced product availability.”

While the consumer price index (CPI) is the better known price gauge, the Federal Reserve prefers to follow the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index in setting its interest-rate policies to fight inflation. The PCE price index tracks the actual purchases consumers are making each month while the CPI follows a fixed market basket of goods.

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed that initial jobless claims last week totaled 205,000. The latest print brings the four-week moving average for new claims to its lowest in 52 years, reflecting a very tight labor market. 

Merck (MRK) received authorization from the FDA for its anti-viral coronavirus pill, the second at-home treatment approved in the US. This follows Pfizer, who received approval for their COVID pill yesterday. 

The pill developed by Merck in conjunction with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, called molnupiravir, was shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30% in clinical trial data. Pfizer's pill was reported to be 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients.

On Wednesday, the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated. 

Moreover, the Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

**Highlights**

* November sales of new U.S. homes jumped 12.4% to a seven-month high. The Census Bureau reported that new home sales rose 82,000 last month from October to 744,000, buoyed by low mortgage rates and higher demand in the housing industry.
* U.S. durable goods orders rose by 2.5% in November, up from the prior month, boosted by a sharp rise in aircraft orders.
* Core capital goods orders, a measure of business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, fell 0.1% after an upwardly revised 0.9% increase in October
* Electric carmaker Tesla Inc will stop allowing video games to be played on its infotainment systems while its vehicles are moving, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday.
* Meta (FB) appealed the UK’s ruling that it must sell moving-image company Giphy.
* fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. are expected to jump 42.8% to 97,417 electric vehicles from a year ago and 28.8% over the previous quarter, the latest automotive industry forecast from auto information company TrueCar.
* TikTok was the most visited website in the entire internet in 2021, beating out Google.
* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.

Now I want to invest in stocks like Paypal & Microsoft (US stock market). Furthermore I am interested in the ETFs VOO & VTI which are also from the USA. These positions are open for purchase in the platform in which I am registered.

However, I wonder if I will have problems regarding taxes if I invest money in these positions. The platform itself does not give any answer regarding taxes. Will I be liable to pay taxes in the USA? Will IRS come after me?

Can anyone help me with this? Would it cause any problems or can I invest without any worries?"
792,2021-12-23 09:12:55,"Novavax stock jumps nearly 5% following positive early COVID-19 vaccine dataNovavax Inc. shares gained in the extended session Wednesday after the biotech drug maker said initial data showed its COVID-19 vaccine booster showed immune responses against the omicron variant. Novavax NVAX, -4.07% shares ended after-hours trading up 4.8%, after rising as much as 6% and dropping as much as 8% from their Wednesday close of $183.30. The company said data showed a two-dose regimen of its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine demonstrated “broad cross-reactivity against omicron and other circulating variants from a primary 2-dose regimen, with responses that increased following a third dose at six months.”

“We are encouraged that boosted responses against all variants were comparable to those associated with high vaccine efficacy in our Phase 3 clinical trials, suggesting that NVX-CoV2373 can play an important role in the ongoing fight against new variants,” said Gregory Glenn, Novavax president of research and development, in statement.

“Given the continued evolution of the coronavirus, the development of an omicron vaccine could be necessary. Novavax has cloned, expressed and characterized the omicron spike protein vaccine and will soon enter the GMP-phase of production,” Glenn said. “We expect to begin clinical studies in the first quarter of 2022.”

Novavax shares are up 59% over the past 12 months, compared with a 27% gain in the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.02%.

Going to share some general information, and looking to see what you guys outlook is regarding this stock.  It's been flourishing the past few months, and even during the down trend that a lot of stocks took over the past month, it still managed to flourish in the semiconductor industry.

Currently around $650 per share

12 month price projection  
High - $775.00  
Median - $685.00  
23 of 31 currently rating at a Buy on CNN Business

3 M - 32.83%  
1 Y - 53.07%  
5 Y - 266.61%

They're currently around an all time high, so maybe not the best time to purchase.  But then again, if the outlook is strong then you have to get in when you can?

Do you guys foresee this price dropping some or correcting anytime soon?  Or is this a properly valued company at 270B.

P/E - 43.07

Div - 2.23 (soon to be changing to $4.10)

Avg Volume 3.52 Million

Just looking to see what you guys thoughts are, and if you think this would be a decent long term investment?  What sectors are they actively engaged in within the semiconductor market?  Cell phones?  Data centers?  What is their strongest position?

Anyway, looking for any and all thoughts on this as a potential investment.  Something that might be competitive with the growth of AMD, NVDA, and others in the semiconductor industry.

Thanks in advance for any and all knowledge."

803,2021-12-22 23:53:12,"Novavax Says Early Data Shows Covid-19 Vaccine Protects Against Omicron - WSJ Article[Novavax](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVAX) Inc. [NVAX **-4.07%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVAX?mod=chiclets)said its two-dose [Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-gets-first-authorization-in-indonesia-11635784579?mod=article_inline) demonstrated “strong immune responses” against the Omicron variant and other variants of the coronavirus, citing initial data.

Still, the company said neutralization against the Omicron variant was “4-fold lower” than it was against the original strain of the virus, suggesting that a booster shot or a new Omicron-specific vaccine would be beneficial.

A third shot six months after the first two doses indicated an increase in antibodies to levels associated with protection seen in earlier large clinical trials, the Maryland-based company said Wednesday. In those trials, the vaccine demonstrated efficacy of around 90%.

The company said it could begin manufacturing its Omicron-specific vaccine in early January and start clinical trials in the first quarter of 2022.

“We are encouraged that boosted responses against all variants were comparable to those associated with high vaccine efficacy in our Phase 3 clinical trials,” said Gregory Glenn, Novavax’s president of research and development.

“Given the continued evolution of the coronavirus, the development of an Omicron vaccine could be necessary. Novavax has cloned, expressed and characterized the Omicron spike protein vaccine and will soon enter the GMP-phase of production,” he added.

Novavax shares rose 5.29% to $193 in after-hours trading.

Earlier this week, Novavax’s vaccine was [recommended for use](https://www.wsj.com/articles/novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-recommended-for-use-in-eu-11640010462?mod=article_inline) by the European Medicines Agency, marking the first endorsement by a major regulator of a shot that uses an established technology.

Novavax will begin shipping vaccines to the EU’s 27 member states next month. In August, the European Commission struck a deal with the drugmaker for 200 million doses of its shot.

Novavax, based in Gaithersburg, Md., and supported with $1.6 billion from the U.S. government, has yet to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration because of manufacturing issues that have held up its application. It plans to file for FDA approval by the end of the year. It is already seeking approval in several other countries, including the U.K, Canada and Australia."
804,2021-12-22 23:11:54,"GRTX looks like a solid near-term value play. 2-5XJust found something interesting. Galera Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GRTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, just reversed clinical findings that caused the stock to plummet a couple months ago.  I see this as a value play and analysts raising price targets appear to agree.

Here’s the thing: 2 months ago, GRTX gapped 70% from $7.50 to $2.29 but it turns out that the reason it fell was a faulty third-party report.  Due to “an error made by the contract research organization” their cancer treatment actually “did meet the primary goal of the trial.”  This error was apparently due to a mistake with the contractor's computer code. Now, per their recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1563577/000119312521356165/d235822dex991.htm), their treatment “Avasopasem has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)” and they plan to file new applications in January.

On the heels of this news, two company insiders have just reported acquiring more shares. SEC links [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563577/000089924321049011/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) and [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1563577/000089924321049012/xslF345X03/doc4.xml). 

Calling this disclosure “stunning,” Citigroup just raised their price target to $20 and all analysts covering the company have upgraded their ratings to a “Buy”. 

Essentially, the news that caused the gap down has just been reversed.  Shares currently trade at around $4. Filling that gap to $7-8 and rising to levels just before the false report was issued, represents an 80-100% gain from here. The average price target is now $15.50, representing a 350-500% upside from current levels.

This is a very low float stock, so it can achieve those levels very fast.  There are only 26 million shares outstanding and the available float is a mere 10.5 million shares.  Apparently, the borrow fee is over 100%.

Lastly, the company has a healthy [pipeline](https://investors.galeratx.com/static-files/dcfc4907-65f7-4ca9-915c-d37eb17339ff) and is fundamentally sound.  

Current market cap is only $111 million and they have 80% of that in cash, enough for 2 years of operations.  Last ER, the company reported, “cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $88.7 million. Galera expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable Galera to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2023”."

**Nasdaq: 15,521.89 (+180.81) (+1.18%)**

The US markets extended their rally inching up higher today and the S&P regained most of the losses it made during the current disastrous December. With the VIX falling down to under 19 for the first time in the last week, the markets look set for a Santa Claus rally with one more day of trading before Christmas. 

In a positive sign for Covid-19 (a misnomer) FDA authorized the first pill to treat the disease from Pfizer. With data coming in from South Africa that Omicron has 80% lower hospitalization risk than the other strains, the year-end rally looks even more plausible. 

Tesla was up by more than 7% today after Elon Musk said he has completed his sale of 10% shares. Musk said in an interview with the satirical website Babylon Bee that this should more than cover his estimated tax bill of over $10 billion. Ever since Musk said about his sale of 10% in the Twitter poll on November 8, the stock has been under pressure and lost more than 25% during the period.

Oil prices climbed up higher today with crude inventories down by 4.7 million barrels. The larger-than-expected drawdown in the inventories propelled the crude prices shaking off the Omicron worries.  

Amazon web services went through another outage today. The disruption affected wide range of online giants who are increasingly critical to day-today life. This is the third high-profile disruption in as many weeks. Amazon’s stock has underperformed the other FAANG stocks this year and these continuous outages does not look good for the stock going into the new year.

808,2021-12-22 21:47:59,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Dec 22, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 22, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly higher on Wednesday, with all three major indexes extending yesterday’s gains, as market participants digested FDA approval of a Pfizer’s (PFE) oral coronavirus treatment and new reports about US gross-domestic product (GDP) and consumer confidence.

**Notable Numbers**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.00%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.22%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.71%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.99%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.77%
* Tesla (TSLA): +7.49%
* Alibaba (BABA): -4.07%
* AMC: -5.35%

Pfizer’s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above was authorized by the FDA , making it the first oral treatment which can be taken at home, providing a potentially important tool in the fight against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

The pill, called Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/)

Omicron has overtaken other coronavirus variants to become the dominant strain in the U.S., and now accounts for about three-quarters of new infections, according to the CDC. To fight this, the Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html)

In the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated.

The Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved further in December, following a very modest gain in November. Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.”

She continued, “Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant,"" Franco added. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.”

**Highlights**

* Existing home sales increased by 1.9% to reach a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 6.46 million units in November, [the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/existing-home-sales-november-2021-150006550.html) Consensus economists were looking for a 2.9% increase, according to Bloomberg data. Existing home sales in October had risen at a 0.8% monthly rate.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he has ‘sold enough’ stock.
* shares fell Wednesday following reports that China’s IT regulator suspended partnership with the company for six months for failing to report an open-source security vulnerability to the government.
* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.
* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied Apple Inc's bid to exclude a shareholder proposal that would require the company to inform investors about its use of non-disclosure agreements and other concealment clauses, according to a document viewed by Reuters.

811,2021-12-22 18:30:04,"Can someone please explain to me how executives' stock options works? I'm trying to understand how stock options work for executives of public companies. I often see executives every several quarters acquiring X amount of shares at a low price, and selling that same X amount of shares at the current (higher) price. They perpetually do that such that they maintain the same amount of ownership, but make a nice amount of money each time.

Here's an example, Musk's recent exercise of his stock options (not hating on him btw, I'm a fan)

[https://ir.tesla.com/\_flysystem/s3/sec/000089924321044060/000089924321044060-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000089924321044060/000089924321044060-gen.pdf)

I understand that is how options work, but I'm having trouble understanding it in the context of where these options come from. For example, say a CEO acquires and sells 10,000 shares. He sold them to any buyer in the stock market, say someone on Robinhood for example. Where did the 10,000 shares that he acquired (at the cheaper price) come from? I'm assuming he bought them from the corporation itself? Corporations typically keep a reserve of their stocks, right? In order to maintain this, the corporation would have to continually buy back stocks, such that they can continue to award options to their executives, right? When a company owns some of its own stocks, where can you see this on the ownership breakdown of the company? Anyone have an example they can send?"

I recently had the idea that inflations gonna give it to us all soon. I was trying to come up with strategies that are easy to exercise in poorly developed financial markets (Europe).


I came up with the strategy of getting a loan for the amount I’m comfortable investing for 1-2 years and using the shares bought + existing portfolio as collateral. Will be investing mostly in value stocks, as they are supposedly performing comparatively better during inflation periods. 
Like this I’m effectively investing 2 years worth of budget immediately and will pay back the loan over time with my salary.

Financing is dirt cheap so the interest on the loan is not an issue.

As inflation will have an impact on the real value of the loan, but stocks will probably be fine it could be an Inflation play.

I'm looking for advise on investments in stocks in the cybersecurity, semiconductors, travel, and possibly in the pharmaceutical arenas. Here's what I've been thinking so far...

Pharma - RHHBY, MRK?? 

Semi - NVDA (already got some of those), ADI, NXPI??

travel - LUV??

cybersecurity - NO IDEA! but would love to hear opinions.

I'm not intending on keeping any money in bonds or indexes so please do not suggest I do that."

825,2021-12-22 07:10:21,"Elon Musk says he’s ‘sold enough’ Tesla stock to satisfy his 10% goalElon Musk said Tuesday he’s met his goal of selling 10% of his stake in Tesla Inc., and criticized California for “overtaxation.” In a nearly hourlong podcast interview with the satirical website the Babylon Bee, the Tesla TSLA, +4.29% CEO said: “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here.”

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Musk exercised 2 million more options and sold nearly 584,000 more Tesla shares Tuesday, bringing the total number of shares sold over the past month-plus to about 13.5 million — slightly shy of the roughly 17 million shares that constituted his 10% stake as of Nov. 7, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell. He’s made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time he’s also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.

Musk also tweeted Sunday night that he will pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. That equates to about 8.06 million of his recently sold shares going to his tax bill on stock options set to expire next year. Musk, who has insulted top Democrats in recent weeks who have called for him to pay more in taxes, took a parting shot at California’s high taxes.

“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.

This year, Musk moved his residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters from California to Texas, which has significantly lower taxes. Musk is the world’s wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with a fortune of about $245 billion — up nearly $89 billion this year alone. In Tuesday’s podcast, Musk reiterated that his wealth is tied up in stock. “It’s not like I’ve got some sort of massive cash balance,” he said. Tesla shares gained more than 4% Tuesday and are up 33% year to date. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,100% over the past three years.

I think we're gonna sell off at least 10 to 20% and then everyone will have an ""excuse"" to put money to work again?

Trip Advisor ([TRIP](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=TRIP)) is in travel related business, which I'm think most VFers would know so no other background provide.   
 

IMO several threads are working their way through the travel business, such as, but not limited to:   
1- Gov's are hesitant or out right refusing to revert to locks downs   
2- People are reluctant to participate in more restrictions   
3- There's tremendous built up anticipation to ""do something""   
4- Virus variants are not as potent as original    
5- Etc (Each of you can add, delete, argue, any/all of these and far more)   
 

At some point travel stocks are going to bottom, & that's  undebatable. So only ? is when. I have no idea when, at what price, etc  but I'm suggesting we are getting near that point.    
 

[TRIP](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=TRIP) has had a nice 2 Dy bump. And it has done this on low volume, whereas related travel stocks such as American Air ([AAL](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=AAL)), Carnival Cruise ([CCL](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=CCL)) & Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) have also bounced nicely AND exceeded the 5 Dy Avg Volume, a few their 20 Dy Avgs.   
 

What interesting about [TRIP](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=TRIP)  is its Shorts. The data is from Schwab, is dated a/o 9Dec, making it  'dated' and is showing Shorties are almost 8%. But it is over a Wk old.   
 

If these Shorties exist when [TRIP](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=TRIP) starts to turn, or if it even runs up a few more days, then those Short folks are gonna think whether to bail.   
 

Not making this post to suggest playing a short squeeze but because I  feel the time may be right to start looking, & in my case, moving  into this type of stock, now.   
 

[TRIP](https://www.valueforum.com/ratings/rating.mpl?symbol=TRIP) also offers some interesting Call & Put Options, weekly.

832,2021-12-22 03:57:17,"Top picks for 2022?As 2021 comes to an end through a bumpy last few weeks but an overall good EOY growth on the SPY and Nasdaq, I am wondering what your speculative, through research and DD of course, growth stocks are for the coming year. Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?

Here are my thoughts:

I am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.

SoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

Im also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year. In 2022, venmo, owned by paypal, is coming to amazon which is exciting news!

What are your thoughts and top picks for 2022?"

The market is unsustainable is her op (hell that sentiment is shared by many pros)... Cramer was going over different levels of resistance (eg if this one's crossed then the market could drop down to this lower one etc)... 

so what are you going to do if a major correction does happen?... Especially since there are so many younger people on here who've never been through a really long and sustained correction.

841,2021-12-21 23:25:03,"Opportunity: Low Retail Volume + High Short InterestThis setup with stocks that have low retail volume/interest + high short interest has the potential to be explosive. Let me explain.

I was watching a meet Kevin video (I know I'm a dumbass) and he brought up some data that he found with one of his expensive resources that is commonly used with big banks and hedge funds. Essentially, these institutions, since the gamester fiasco, pay extreme attention towards retail volume on stocks they're shorting. The examples that Kevin brought up were Corsair, Shift, and Lemonade. With these names, it appears that when retail begins buying the dips and pouring in, hedge funds quickly close their short positions in an attempt to minimize their losses or take profits, then, when retail interest dies down, they pile on with their shorts again.

I found this very intriguing as I believe it presents an extremely large opportunity. First, just the sight of a few retail investors pouring into stocks like this will cause these institutions to RAPIDLY close their short positions, the actual price movement may not even be that significant but when they observe data displaying a surge in retail volume, they will flee for the hills. Additionally, institutions at this time of year are looking to close short positions on stocks like CRSR, Shift, and LMND because they're already up a significant amount, the year is coming to an end, and they may be anticipating a Santa clause rally .

All of these factors lead me to believe that names with low retail volume and high short interest are extremely large opportunities at this moment. I personally like CRSR as it seems they have the best fundamentals compared to other names that fit this criteria but there may also be other opportunities out there.  


What do ya'll think?

Is this strategy viable?

What are some other names that fall under this criteria?

**Additionally, I do not endorse any of these names, mods please do not take down my post, I put in genuine effort and I'm not trying to pump anything, just spreading a kinda cool strategy**

It will do over a 100 million in revenue in 2021, with a gross profit of over 90 million. It has roughly 86 million cash on hand and zero debt. With a market cap of only 256 million it would seem to be grossly undervalued. It has also already purchased the majority of the materials for it's test kits so it should only benefit from any inflationary pressure.

It has a PE of 6.35 where the industry average, for much larger and more established players is 32.

Ignoring all the room for growth with home testing, the lack of test kits due to Omicron and a multitude of other tests for other wide spread diseases, just on the basis of it's current revenue/ revenue growth it's hard not to see this as a value.

Now this stock has always been held back by the assumption that eventually the need for PCR testing will dissappear, which has been a reasonable assumption. But if you start to question that assumption it's hard not to see CODX as a rare value/growth stock?

**Dow: 35,492.70 (+560.54) (+1.60%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,341.09 (+360.14) (+2.40%)**

Following the rout yesterday, Global stock markets were on the upswing today and the same was reflected in the US markets. The indices recouped the Monday losses and closed above Friday’s (12/17) close though nothing much has changed in terms of the concerns on the Omicron variant, which is fast becoming the dominant variant throughout the US and the World. Even with the cases rising and restrictions increasing, the general public is in a much better position to handle this new variant; vaccinations and general awareness on masks and social distancing is sure to help this leg of the pandemic to be in the rear-view mirror with much less damage.

Shares of Micron Technology was up by more than 10% following its beat of topline and EPS in its Q1 earnings and the subsequent strong chip demand forecast. The company’s shares have been trading sideways this year but has been attracting lots of attention on its DRAM and NAND Flash storage.

EV Company and pandemic-era favorite Nikola will pay a fine of $125 Mn in settlement with SEC over alleged false claims by Nikola’s ex-CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola neither accepted nor denied the claims of Milton in terms of the settlement. Nikola currently trades above $9 which is a fraction of $70+ it traded in mid-2020s. Hindenburg’s damaging report and the subsequent watered-down deal with GM reversed the tides for this stock.

Another meme stock, WISH, jumped up by more than 14% today. For the year though the ecommerce stock is down by more than 80%.

Airlines and Cruise stocks were all up today with DAL (+5.9%), AAL (+4.7%), UAL (+6.9%), CCL (+8.7%) and RCL (+5.4%) significantly in the green following a positive report by Bank of America. According to the report, domestic bookings have been largely resilient in the face of Omicron thus far with more softness in the international bookings. Cruise stocks continued the momentum on the favorable commentary by the management of CCL yesterday."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 21, 2021**

***Apologies for no recap yesterday, I was traveling all day back home to spend Christmas with my parents***

The market staged a comeback on Tuesday, with all three major indexes rising more than 1% as market participants digested news of federal involvement to help mitigate the spread of Omicron and the imminent authorization of an at-home COVID treatment.

The Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January. This comes following a report that Omicron has now become the dominant variant in the US, accounting for roughly 73% of all cases reported last week.

New COVID-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases)

Moreover, the White House will deploy 1,000 military personnel to assist at hospitals as capacity starts filling up.   The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year, according to that same Reuters tally.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of approving and regulating new medications, is expected to authorize the Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) coronavirus treatment pills this week.

Last week, Pfizer reported that its COVID pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/)

Meera Pandit, global market strategist at JP Morgan, said “On the virus side, ultimately what we’ve seen with prior surges and prior variants is that market sell-offs tend to be somewhat contained to a period of time, so we do expect that as we get better and better at dealing with some of these challenges from the economic and market perspective, things will likely settle down despite some of the public health challenges we have ahead.”

In other news, market participants are also processing an unexpected blow to Biden's economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) quashed the administration’s long-deliberated Build Back Better Act, citing concerns about inflation, the national debt and ongoing pandemic.

Looking ahead, there is tons of important economic coming out:

* Wednesday - The Conference Board is set to release its latest consumer confidence index, expected to show an only modest uptick for the month of December.
* Thursday - Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measurement for inflation. Consensus data compiled by Bloomberg showed PCE is projected to climb at a 0.6% month-over-month rate in November.

**Highlights**

* President Joe Biden in remarks Tuesday afternoon said he was considering a reversal of recent travel restrictions in light of Omicron
* AT&T Inc said on Tuesday it was selling its advertising unit, Xandr, to Microsoft. Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.
* Following the blocking infrastructure bill, Goldmans Sachs (GS) and Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody’s, cut US GDP forecasts for 2022.
* Moody’s, one of the main credit ratings agencies in the US, once again gave Apple the highest ‘AAA’ credit
* The EU approved Microsoft’s (MSFT) $16 billion acquisition of Nuance, an AI-powered text to speech company
* Workers at a Starbucks (SBUX) store in Seattle, the coffee giant’s hometown, say they aim to unionize, adding momentum to the organizing efforts at the chain.
* Global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021,  $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd has received approval from Taiwan's investment commission to set up a chip manufacturing plant in Japan.
* Alphabet Inc's YouTube began restoring access to Walt Disney Co channels on its platform on Sunday, after the companies reached a distribution agreement to end a two-day blackout."
850,2021-12-21 21:03:32,"UPDATE: If news media had any logical consistency they would now be saying ""The market is up today! Omicron variant is cured!""Yesterday's thread deserves the logical follow up.  Well, media said Omicron caused the market to drop yesterday.    Ok, well, the markets are up nicely today.   How come no financial media outlet is saying Omicron is now cured, since the market is just as green today as it was red yesterday?  Because that would be ludicrous to say.  As someone else said, maybe the markets dropped because of the Jamie Spears conservatorship developments.

This is a great lesson for investors and traders.  Yes, news absolutely moves markets.  But, I will reiterate to ignore all hindsight fluff news that tries to explain events after the fact.  Today, the market is up because there are more buyers than sellers. Not because Omicron variant is now cured, which is supposedly why the market dropped yesterday.  If it really was Omicron that caused the market to drop, the market would drop again today, because Omicron is not yet cured.

Since the market is up today, either the financial press was full of shit yesterday or Omicron variant is cured today!"

Sold 50 shares for a $22 loss when it made a comeback and wanted to sell the rest for a $22 profit so that I get away with a perfect break-even because this man right here never sells for a loss...I kept waiting for it to hit my PT for a mere $22 profit and it never happened...it fell so I bought 25 more shares to avg down to $259 with a total of 45 shares so I can sell when it spiked again.

Their roster of clients include PII, PAG, TSN, PEP, GE, CVNA, GEICO, alongside several others.

There's obviously a risk, but the risk vs reward potential is what's very attractive about TKX especially at this valuation, and the new global environment for supply chain management requirements.

Please poke holes in it and give me timelines for when some of these factors might come to an end.

Literally every factor that influences inflation is going absolutely bonkers right now, and I don't see it dying down any time soon.

We have:
1. Low interest rates
2. Massively increased money supply that has yet to find an equilibrium
3. Massive personal savings for many middle class Americans compared to recent years 
4. Higher wages 
5. More disposable income due to working from home
6. High oil prices
7. Low unemployment 
8. Huge increases in public spending 
9. Tax reductions and huge tax credits and subsidies
10. Shortages in necessary goods (cars, lumber, steel, food, microchips, etc.)
11. More tariffs and industrial disputes
12. More environmental regulations
13. Deficit financing
14. Natural disasters (imagine how many cars and homes that are being wiped out from tornados and fires that are occurring more often)
15. Pauses on debt repayment

In 2009, the government had to subsidize people to buy cars and homes. Now you can't even buy a decent selection of 2 year old cars for MSRP. It took 2 months for my friend's order for home fencing material to come in. Graphics cards are going for 3x's their MSRP.

There is so much pent up demand that there will be shortages and inflation for at least another year. I don't expect many of the prices to even come back down when the market finds the equilibrium.

The only ways I see inflation going down are an increase in supply of these extremely in demand goods, repayment of debts like student loans, increases in interest rates, increasing unemployment, and other things that the government will not do because it will cause hardship or harm financial markets.

Some things that have yet to happen that will increase inflation are:
1. An increase in the currently record low velocity of money
2. Increased oil prices
3. More natural disasters
4. Increased government spending (such as the build back better plan"
859,2021-12-21 17:02:36,"Advice on building a portfolio for 7-10 years to help pay off student loans?My student loan payments, like everyone else, are going to be starting soon and I started looking at options to potentially pay them off early. Paying a big chunk off right now or paying extra each month isn’t going to reduce my minimum monthly payments and just means I’ll have less money for emergencies or other situations right now. So instead I want to set aside any cash I would have used towards a lump sum payment or extra payments each month and put it in a portfolio with a 7-10 year time horizon and then when (hopefully) I have enough, pay off the remainder of the loan and be done with it. This is in the hopes it has a better return than paying off the loans and if needed, I can withdraw. 

I’ve thought about doing a mix of VTI and QQQ and calling it a day or doing a mix of individual stocks but curious to see what people with more experience/knowledge than me think.

Which stocks/etfs/etc would you pick for this time frame?"

867,2021-12-21 15:13:32,"Is FB a good buy right now?Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for FB. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Meta Platform´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for FB stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in FB. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **97%** of their sales comes from **Advertising**. The other **2%** come from **Other Revenues.**

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 11,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for FB´s stock of **$453 per share**. But because we have to account for **FB´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$454 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With **FB**´s price being at **$324** **per share** right now, it seems undervalued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see FB´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of around **$600 per share** which is higher than what it is now.

**What I´ll do.** I believe FB is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time. Meta Platforms is a good company to invest in and that´s why I will buy shares as soon as I get the chance.

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.

If you want to see my analysis for another stock, please tell me."

Currently they are on track to increase their annual revenue from last year: 10.9B to around 13B, with about ~40% of that being profit on average.  If we look at Q3 alone compared to a company like NVDA who had a massive jump in share price, RKT had income of  3.1B and NVDA 3.4B!  Granted NVDA did increase more YoY revenue wise, RKT is pocketing a ton of cash, and their PE ratio reflects that.

Obviously it's apples to oranges to compare the two in a lot of ways, but as far as pure earnings, I can't see why this stock gets so much hate!

RKTs business model could be solely taking advantage of low interest rates as home buying and refinancing is at a massive demand.  If this pulls back, it will eat their bottom line.  However I believe RKT has the tech to take over the large majority of this market to compensate any relative pullback.  In addition, being a pure software company allows them to have great margins, and expand into other areas quickly.

874,2021-12-21 12:26:40,"ViacomCBS - My favorite Trade for 2022 and 2023**ViacomCBS - A pearl in the sea of overvalued stocks**

First of all,  ViacomCBS is already my second biggest Trade Position with 8% of my portfolio. Im planning to add more shares, so please keep in mind that my opinion is very biased. Also I want to say that im german, so excuse me for my bad english.

**What is ViacomCBS?** ViacomCBS is a media company, which was created by the merger of Viacom with the CBS Corporation. It has TV Entertainment (CBS Group and more), Cable Networks (MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon and more), Filmed Entertainment (Paramount Studios) and Streaming Services (Paramount+ and PlutoTV).

**Some Key Figures:**

Market Cap is \~19B. The P/E Ratio is 7, P/S Ratio is 0,67, Yield is 3,43% with a 25% payout ratio.

So P/E and P/S are way below the historical average, the yield is way above the historical average. It seems that the stock is very undervalued. I think the stock is still undervalued because of the Archegos disaster, which also made the chart of the stock look very ugly.

**But why is it a good Trade now?** We have a very strong growth in the Streaming-Business of the Company. Streaming right now is 1/7 of the companys revenue. In the Q3 of 2021 we can see that Streaming Revenue grew 62% YoY, the revenue with Streaming-Subscriptions grew astonishing 79% YoY.

The two main Streaming-Services, Paramount+ and PlutoTV are both very new in the market (right now mainly the USA), so that their market share will still rise in the next years, which you can see by the current revenue growth. Additional to that, Paramount+ will be introduced to the main european markets in 2022. So its pretty conservative to say, that the streaming segment of ViacomCBS will grow 40/50% over the next 2-4 years.

**Summary:**

We have, by looking at historical averages, a very undervalued stock. While the old segments (Cable, TV, Filming) are not growing that much, we have realy nice potential by the streaming segment, with currently only making 1/7 of the companies revenue, but with high growth now and in the near future. Plus the company will give you a nice 3,43% yield, with a healthy payout ratio of 25%."

As TSLA is such a volatile stock i got into buy/sell multiple times a day, for the most part it worked out well. Currently i have a positive 80k in realized gains, here is where the question comes:

Therefore my question - DISCA or DISCK? I'm not interested in voting (I can't in my online broker), so as long as both receive the same amount of WBD shares next year, I'll buy DISCK. Will DISCK shareholders get slightly fewer WBD shares or is that not allowed under US law just because DISCK in the current structure have no voting rights but with equal economic rights to DISCA? 

I will also buy some T soon BTW to get some WBD shares from that side as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

DiDi Global, the parent company of DiDi Chuxing, which was delisted from the US, plans to list in HK by way of introduction to meet the HKSE's listing requirements.

Sources reported that as DiDi has been listed in the US for less than two years, it has not been possible to list in Hong Kong through a secondary listing, and that DiDi may list in H-share by way of introduction, which does not require financing and is a relatively simple process.

The listing by way of introduction will be in the form of issued shares, **so the company will not issue new shares or raise new capital, making the listing less costly.**

According to the report, the scrutiny of a Hong Kong listing depends on whether the company will raise funds from public shareholders, which would be easier if no public financing is required. In addition, **the company will face challenges from cornerstone investors, secondary market investors, and regulators as it delists from the US.**

**Reports suggest that DiDi may be delisted from the NYSE as Going Dark, rather than going private.** Sources close to the matter said that the main reason is a shortage of capital, and that the privatised shares will not only be outstanding, but also a large tranche of shares that will be released on 28 December.

DiDi was listed in New York on 30 June this year with US$4.4 billion raised. Under domestic regulation, at the beginning of this month, it said that it plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and seek a listing in Hong Kong.

Infact it can no longer even be called a margin call, because I AM the one who called the margin, not the other way around.

890,2021-12-21 01:31:15,"Why I loathe investing in indexesThere's nothing more lazy or tedious than being told how ignorant it is to say NOT to invest in indexes.

Investing in indexes means you literally cannot perform any better or worse than 200 million other investors. Which is the definition of staying in the same place you started.

Which is why so much investment plans aim to finish out 30 years of work with the same income you averaged over those 30 years.

Investing in indexes will literally get you nowhere except to retire on your own without a pension plan.

To be able to outperform the market you have to do something different. Even if its just buying dips and selling rips of an index. That strategy won't profit you much but it's better than being some lazy ahole who thinks someday they'll get rich because they invested in VTI or VOO.

Opinions here around not selling any of the above are fine, however I'm more interested in opinions around **sector** **simplification** and **the method(s) you used to accomplish this**.  Say a few years ago you decided to purchase stock in individual companies you were interested in at the time all of which were in the same sector, that interest waned, and now you no longer keep up with these companies with the same vigor.  Now you want to sell those positions but at the same time still wish to maintain sector exposure.

**The questions:**

1. How have you accomplished simplifying your portfolio around things you are no longer interested in keeping up with but **still** wish to maintain sector exposure?
2. My understanding is that buying $VOX within 30 days of selling $CMCSA, $T, and $VZ would **not** trigger a wash-sale.  Is this a correct interpretation?

**Additional note:**

If your suggestion is to trade out laggards, as you perceive them, with better long term winners in the same sector then this is still welcome with these questions; over just going with a sector based ETF.  I'd like to see your DD and/or sources as to why if going this particular advise route.

The logic is the half-back trading pattern carrying over into tomorrow after an end of day ""one-time-framing"".

End of day formed the one-time-frame and RUSSELL cleared it and already began the half-back while SPY hasn't cleared out all its buying pressure so it may push up tomorrow before half-backing.

Once it pivots around the half-back, it may continue its uptrend end of next day and close higher than today's close.

911,2021-12-20 20:13:39,"The market hit a bottomI'm pretty sure I said this last week, and today has tested it but not by much. I'm still calling us near a local bottom - not because of an expectation of January Effect, or the tax loss harvesting to go away after Decem-bear, etc.

In the below image I track unique patterns I call ""hidden-dojis"". A doji is a trading indicator that suggests indecision. Indecision is when Bears and Bulls are pretty evenly matched.

These indecisions mean one of two outcomes has to come true, either more down, or more up. And I do not believe we are facing a technical correction or a bearish market for the short term. Nothing suggests it. Financials are good, macro-economics are good, no one actually gives 2 shjts about Omicron (that's just news fear mongering).

Bottom line is everything is looking good for market outlook, which means the sell-off is a technical one, not a fundamental one. Call it tax loss harvesting, risk reduction, whatever, it's just traders being traders.

I point to the two hidden dojis, the left side is counter trend (up in a down trend) and signifies the indecisiveness of bulls. Then we hit the center drop which was renewed bearish strength.

Then we hit the counter trend hidden doji on the right side, which is down in an uptrend. And I expected to see it since I first identified this trade last week.

Hence last week on the same expectation I said we hit a bottom.

I didn't expect it to be so dramatic (making today near the absolute bottom) but that's OK.

I expected a reverse head and shoulders pattern but we are still queued for a triple bottom pattern which is simply a variant of the head and shoulders.

If we were facing a Bearish change of sentiment what we would look for is a significantly sideways (low volatility) week before Christmas, or a new lower low by Christmas or next week.

If that happens, then I think we are pretty much confirmed to be in a correction territory.

But, if tomorrow is strong. I think that'll crush the shorts and the week will finish strong or OK, and January will kick off with a bang.

And that's the bet I'm leaning toward based on the technicals below.

I use GS as a proxy, the pattern exists in SPY as well but is less ""clean"".

912,2021-12-20 20:00:42,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Agrees to Buy Medical-Records Systems Provider Cerner Corp. (CERN) for $28.3 Billion All-Cash Dealhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-buy-cerner-28-3-151236475.html

(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. agreed to acquire medical-records systems provider Cerner Corp. for about $28.3 billion, a deal that would add a broad customer base in the health care industry to bolster the software maker’s cloud-computing and database businesses.


The all-cash transaction, Oracle’s biggest-ever deal, will see Oracle pay $95 a share, the companies announced Monday in a statement. The price represents a 20% premium over Cerner’s market value last Thursday, before the deal talks first became public. Oracle shares slid 4.3% at 1:40 p.m. Monday in New York, while Cerner shares gained less than 1% to $90.57.

Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said the acquisition should be “immediately accretive to Oracle’s earnings” on an adjusted basis in the first full fiscal year after closing and contribute “substantially more to earnings in the second fiscal year and thereafter.” The transaction is expected to close next year, the companies said.

Oracle, the second-biggest software maker by revenue, is best known for legacy database products. The company has struggled in recent years to gain ground in cloud computing, in which companies rent data storage and analytic power from large server centers, trailing far behind market leaders such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

The deal for Cerner gives Oracle a huge foothold in technology for the health care industry -- a sector expected to spend $15.8 billion on cloud infrastructure and software by 2023, according to market researcher IDC -- given Cerner’s robust user base, which includes many of the top U.S. hospital systems. And as Oracle moves more of Cerner’s systems onto its own cloud infrastructure, the company gains an important case study to help future sales.

“Data is where it’s at in health care. The ability to not just have a customer and an increased footprint, but to showcase Oracle’s database capabilities is a big thing for them,” said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at advisory firm Valoir.

Microsoft, too, sees the opportunity in health care. It announced in April that it would spend $19.6 billion for speech-recognition pioneer Nuance Communications Inc. to gain artificial-intelligence technology focused on helping doctors predict patients’ needs and upgrading hospitals’ digital record-keeping.

The challenge for Oracle is persuading Cerner customers, many that probably already run some Oracle products in their own corporate date centers, to make the jump to its modern, cloud-based applications on the promise that more tailored health care offerings will be available in the next few years.

“If I’m a hospital system and I’m trying to upgrade into something new, Oracle suddenly becomes a very interesting play,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anurag Rana. “You have a massive, large untapped market and if Oracle can create a good product out of it, you are going to start to attract more hospitals.”

David Feinberg, formerly vice president of Google Health, took over as Cerner’s chief executive officer on Oct. 1, saying a major goal would be to use data as a diagnostic tool to help doctors and nurses improve patient care. Two years ago, Cerner announced a deal with Amazon’s cloud division to develop programs trying to predict medical diagnoses or recommend courses of treatment for patients. It’s unclear how Oracle will navigate that challenge, given it would be a complicated undertaking to move systems that are now supported by AWS onto Oracle’s infrastructure.

Cerner’s choice of Feinberg as CEO highlighted the company’s move toward “a strategy based on big data, population health management and consumerism -- and away from the legacy health records business,” Donald Hooker, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said when Feinberg was named to the post in August.

Cerner, which competes with Epic Systems Corp. and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, among others, generated $5.51 billion in revenue during 2020, and sales are projected to rise by 5% to $5.8 billion this year. The company is based in North Kansas City, Missouri, has about 23,000 employees.

The acquisition is Oracle’s biggest since its 2016 purchase of NetSuite Inc., a deal valued at $8.7 billion. That purchase has provided Oracle with financial software targeted to small- and mid-sized businesses, which has become among Oracle’s fastest growing products.

Oracle had $22.8 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Nov. 30, according to its most recent quarterly earnings filing. The company said it doesn’t expect the Cerner acquisition to impact its investment grade credit rating.

After several years of stagnant revenue, the Austin, Texas-based company has produced six straight quarters of sales growth, sending its shares to a record high on Dec. 15 before the news of the talks with Cerner became public."

914,2021-12-20 19:50:42,"FB - is it going to tank hard?FB (rebranded as META because it was so hated) looks interesting. It looks like it could be a distribution or an accumulation. And this matters, because what comes next is markdown or markup.

I'm leaning toward FB being in a distribution phase. It was in a markup phase, then rapidly dropped, it never went through a distribution phase. That means that any large funds and banks might still have sizeable positions in FB.

Therefore any price support it has now is a distribution phase where those same funds will buy to support the price, then sell to exit their positions. This technique is called bracketing and they bracket a price range, say $320 floor and $340 ceiling.

Any time the price approaches $340 they add selling volume to exit their position, and if it weakens the price they edge off.

As the price falls, they start to buy toward the sharp declines on low volume to float the price and keep it within the bracket.

This is the technique of distribution if they are exiting the position.

It could be an accumulation if funds think this is a support level and they are adding to their position (the reverse of what is described above).

Shorting at the top of the bracket to keep the price down as they build their position.

What do YOU think FB is doing?

I lean toward distribution. I think once the funds have less exposure there will be a markdown, the price will fall even further."

>The bank is recommending cyclical quality stocks from its high-quality large-cap portfolio, which should help investors capture some upside and outperform to the downside. Each stock has an overweight rating by Wells Fargo analysts, a market cap of more than $3 billion, and “favorable” quality, which is based on debt to EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), profit margins and return on equity.

> “We believe it is time to move up in quality and down in risk,” Harvey said. “The Fed has turned hawkish; we are seeing pricing fatigue; growth is decelerating; market froth is abundant; and risk-averse options are relatively cheap but limited... so expect pressure on multiples.”


....

>Harvey noted that much of consumers’ pent-up demand has been satisfied and retailers might have a harder time hiking prices going forward.

> “We are not worried about the overall health of the U.S. consumer,” Harvey said. “Our focus is more the marginal change as it relates to future spending, since we are beginning to suspect the consumer is no longer the price-taker it was six to 12 months ago.”

I don’t like to sell panic. I like to buy panic.”

Cramer's experience is relevant to the market because like it or not, a lot of people follow his recommendations. If he comes through Omicron relatively unscathed, I think he's going to be very bullish and his audience will follow his lead.

We were rolling dice to pick the page and stock from that page but decided it will be better to just do ETFs until she can actually pick out her own stocks.

Following a night of street celebrations at the end of a polarizing runoff race, the SP IPSA index opened 6.83 percent down, before regaining some ground.

The peso ceded 3.02 percent to the US dollar to open the day at a historic high of 872.61.

In November, the IPSA index gained more than nine percent when far-right fiscal conservative Jose Antonio came out on top in the first election round.

The peso rebounded then by 3.5 percent to 800 to the dollar.

Boric, 35, garnered nearly 56 percent of the vote compared to 44 percent for Jose, who conceded even before the final result was known.

Tens of thousands of Chileans took to the streets of the capital and other cities to celebrate Boric's victory, honking car horns in approval, brandishing pro-Boric placards, waving the rainbow LGBTQ flag and shouting: ""Viva Chile!""

Fireworks lit the skies for hours on end.

Boric had campaigned on the promise of installing a ""social welfare"" state, increasing taxes and social spending in a country with one of the world's largest gaps between rich and poor.

Branded a ""communist"" by his detractors, he vowed in his first official address Sunday to ""expand social rights"" in Chile, but to do so with ""fiscal responsibility.""

""We will do it protecting our macro-economy, we will do it well... to improve pensions and health care,"" he said.

930,2021-12-20 14:38:42,"$UAN - 2022 $60 Yield Distributions MultibaggerDisclaimer: I own options and shares of $UAN and have been in $UAN since March of 2021.

This is not financial or stock advice, but my analysis of the company.

I’m going to be explaining why CVR Partners ($UAN) is an interesting company in today’s market.

Their Website: https://investors.cvrpartners.com/


**Glossary for Clarity:**

$UAN - Referring to the security/stock

UAN - Referring to the product Urea-Ammonium Nitrate

CVR / CVR Partners - Referring to the company

Sidenote: UAN is sold as UAN28 and UAN32, referring to the nitrogen content of 28% or 32%.


**What does CVR Partners do?**

CVR Partners is a fertilizer commodity company that produces two products for sale. These two products are Urea-Ammonium Nitrate and Anhydrous Ammonia. These two products are used as nitrogen fertilizers in the agriculture industry, their largest market. They have two plants that produce these products. One is located in Coffeyville, Kansas. The other is located in East Dubuque, Illinois. The plant in Coffeyville uses petroleum coke as their input to produce Ammonia and UAN. The plant in East Dubuque uses natural gas as an input product, and can produce a variable amount of UAN and Ammonia, therefore they can sell whatever is more profitable at the time.


**Brief History of UAN and Ammonia pricing and supply:**

Prices of UAN and Ammonia were at quite profitable levels for CVR in 2012, which is reflected by $UAN price at the time. After 2012, the prices of these chemicals entered a downturn. Lots of production came online around the world driving prices of fertilizers down. UAN went from a high price of around $300/ton in 2012 to the lowest point of around $120/ton in 2019. Ammonia also went from its highs of $800/ton in 2012 to around $280/ton in 2019. However, covid has caused rippling supply chain issues around the world, and fertilizer is no exception to that.


Because of these global supply chain issues, costs of commodities worldwide have surged. UAN currently sits at around $600/ton and Ammonia sits at around $1350/ton, dwarfing 2012 prices, and there is no end in sight to price increases as there is a global shortage of nitrogen fertilizer products. The cost of natural gas worldwide, especially in Europe, has skyrocketed. Almost all nitrogen fertilizer plants, other than CVR’s Coffeyville plant, use natural gas as the feedstock. This has resulted in nitrogen fertilizer plants worldwide shutting down, including almost all European plants, as the cost of natural gas in Europe has seen an exponential increase due to supply constraints, making production of any fertilizers via natural gas feedstock untenable. Gas prices in the USA will not surge nearly as high, as the US is the largest producer of gas, whereas Europe has to rely on Russian gas lines for their supplies, and they cannot get along with Putin’s regime. These supply chain issues may now be further exacerbated with the Omicron variant of COVID spreading like crazy, resulting in more supply chain issues, extending the high European gas prices.

**You can read more about the surging prices of fertilizer as well as see price history here:**

https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2021/12/15/nitrogen-fertilizer-prices-continue


Due to CVR’s Coffeyville production plant using petroleum coke as a feedstock, it has a natural price advantage to traditional nitrogen fertilizer plants that use natural gas as a feedstock, as petroleum coke is a significantly less expensive feedstock on a per ton of fertilizer produced basis. Coffeyville produces about 1300 tons of Ammonia per day and 3000 tons of UAN per day. East Dubuque produces about 1075 tons of Ammonia per day and 1100 tons of UAN per day. It is clear from the above numbers that CVR’s larger producer of UAN, Coffeyville, has a huge cost advantage compared to other producers of UAN worldwide.


Furthermore, UAN has anti dumping import tariffs pending in the USA, which were petitioned by CF Industries, a much larger nitrogen producer in the US. Potash anti dumping tariffs were also successfully petitioned by another company in the US, one that escapes my memory. Potash is another fertilizer that is not nitrogen based, but has and also still is rising in price.

**CVR Partners Company Structure:**

CVR Partners is a Limited Partnership in a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) structure. The General Partner is CVR Energy (Ticker $CVI). CVR Energy is controlled by Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises, and CVR Energy owns approximately 33% of CVR Partners ($UAN). In this way, Carl Icahn has control over CVR Energy, and also has an interest in increasing share price, and increasing distributions from CVR Partners.


This is a beneficial partnership because CVR Energy produces petroleum coke, and CVR Partners gets their petroleum coke from CVR Energy. Because they are in this partnership, transactions are smooth, consistent, and efficient. There is reduced cost for both since CVR’s Coffeyville facility is located in the same exact place as CVR Energy’s oil refinery.


CVR Partners has a policy of distributing all available cash generated each quarter as distributions to unit holders. As such, available cash as determined by management at the end of each quarter will be distributed evenly between all unit holders. There are about 10.68 million shares/units outstanding (CVR Energy owns 33% of this number). Because this is an MLP, there are multiple tax implications that must be taken into consideration that will not be gone over here, as it is too complex for this analysis. However, do not purchase these units in a retirement account.


**CVR Partners Acquisition of Rentech and Debt:**

In late 2015-2016, CVR partners acquired Rentech Nitrogen in a 533 million dollar deal. Rentech Nitrogen became CVR’s current East Dubuque facility. This increased their debt by around 500 million, and they have had this debt ever since, due to the downturn in fertilizer pricing hitting their ability to pay back the debt hard. Because of this they have around 645 million dollars worth of debt today. Originally, this debt was due in 2023, with an interest rate of 9.25%, and recently 550 million of this debt was refinanced to 2028, with an interest rate of 6.125%. The remaining $95 million due in 2023 was kept, with a plan to pay it off over the next two years at a rate of $15 million each quarter. So far, two partial redemptions have been made at 15 million dollars each, and so there is only $65 million of this 2023 debt left. At the current rate, the 2023 debt will be gone around the end of 2022, beginning of 2023. Though the remaining 2028 debt is still not ideal, it is definitely positive that it was refinanced at a much lower rate and five years out. Lastly, CVR Partners plans to redeem new carbon tax credits in January of 2022. Currently, these credits are estimated to be around $50 million at least, but could potentially be more based on how they are calculated. This will also be applied to debt, and may pay off the 2023 debt faster, or be applied to 2028 debt.


**Calculating Profits and Distributions & Determining a Fair Value for Future 2022 TTM:**

Before going into the future profits, I want to briefly review 2021 distributions:


Distributions for 2021:

Q1: $0

Q2: $1.72

Q3: $2.93

Q4: Estimated at least $4 (Conservative)


CVR is finally getting the higher market prices for their products, as CVR typically presells their products 3-6 months in advance for Q3 and Q4, whereas for Q1 and Q2, they mostly get spot prices. We can see clear proof from the above that their pricing is improving. Now we must estimate for their next year's distributions. To do this I will make some assumptions as listed below:


Production of Ammonia per day = 2375 tons * 365 days

= 866,875 * 95% utilization rate

= 823,000 tons of Ammonia


Production of UAN per day = 4100 tons * 365 days

= 1,496,500 * 95% utilization rate

= 1,421,000 tons of UAN


Because there is a scheduled turnaround for Quarter 3 of 2022, we can expect to lose 8.33% of overall yearly production, as we will lose a third of Q3 production.


Therefore: 1-.0833 = 0.9167


823,000 tons/Ammonia * 0.9167 = 754,000 tons / Ammonia

1,421,000 tons/UAN * 0.9167 = 1,302,000 tons / UAN


Ammonia conversion to UAN rate was between 65%-70% for 2019-2020. Because of higher Ammonia prices, we will assume a lower conversion rate of 65%. We are then left with:


754,000 tons * .35 = 264,000 tons / Ammonia


Lastly, we assume the price for UAN is $550/ton and Ammonia is $1200/ton.


264,000 tons / Ammonia * $1,200 / ton = $316,800,000

1,302,000 tons / UAN * $550 / ton = $716,100,000


Total: $1,032,900,000 from sales of Ammonia and UAN not including any costs


Lastly, we need to figure out the cost of feedstock and production and operations.

Conservatively, we can estimate:

Cost of Revenues: $300 Million

Selling General & Admin Expenses: $25 Million

Depreciation & Amortization: $75 Million


Therefore Operating Income is: $632 Million

There are 10.68 million units: We get about $60 in distributions per share.

This averages $15 per quarter.

At a 10% yield, a historical yield for this company, we get around $600 per share for 2022 TTM.

At a 20% yield, we get around $300 per share for 2022 TTM.

While I did not calculate EBITDA, at a historical 7x-10x EV/EBITDA, this company would be valued somewhere around $300+ easily.


**Why Consider $UAN:**

As inflation continues at its current rate, and commodity prices increase, this company is a great hedge against inflation. It’s highly dependent on the price of UAN and Ammonia, and with the prices skyrocketing with no end in sight, combined with the global shortage, global supply chain issues, and increasing interest rates, this is one of the safest companies to invest in currently. If you buy shares right now, and prices stay the same, nothing goes wrong, you will get around 75% of your money back from distributions alone in a year’s time. This doesn’t account for share price appreciation, which will certainly happen if/when they throw off all this cash in distributions. Prices of UAN and Ammonia also certainly have more room to rise, as gas prices in Europe continue higher and global supply chains continue to be constrained."

I primarily will only buy or sell one legged options (buy calls/puts or implement the wheel) based off my own TA but either the market is too volatile for TA to be of any use or my TA and indicator set up is not set for these current conditions. Or I’m just bad at TA. For reference, I usually will use Bollinger bands, 12,26 ema and MACD and rsi on daily, 4hr, 1hr, and 15 minute time frames.

I’m adjusting some risk management going into next week by utilizing spreads where I didn’t before. Other than that and setting stop losses, I would like some suggestions if anyone could.

The Netherlands returned to full lockdown. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical advisor to Biden, said he expects coronavirus cases in the U.S. to reach record highs this winter, driven by the Omicron variant. He said he expects “significant stress” on hospital systems in some regions of the country.

Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their forecast for U.S. growth for 2022, citing Manchin’s rejection of the Biden spending bill.The Build Back Better bill’s “enactment had already looked likea close call and in light of Manchin’s comments we are adjustingour forecast to remove the assumption that BBB will become law,”Goldman’s economists wrote in a report Sunday. “A failure to pass BBB has negative growth implications.”

unlike most utility's next era energy has a high pe ratio and grows above average. 

most companys that are like NEE grow 2-3% but they pull off an 8% growth rate and their kinda being seen as THE new giant of the energy market.

a big buyer in the company are pension funds looking to get their money out of fossile fuel and into green energy.

The capex of NEE is high logicaly because of its growth rate but the companys doesnt have FCF meaning they spend more money then there is coming in while paying out a 2,5+ billion dollar dividend to shareholders.

next era energy has a lot of debt at 52,5 billion usd while having about 8 billion of operating cashflow. which is by any means high. as 4x operating cashflow to debt would be seen as to high. 

the intrest rate is not realy low at 3%. meaning they pay 1,5 billion to its debt holders. if they would get a lower credit rating this would increase significantly.

the value of next era energy is 30x pe for 2024 profits if ur being optimisitc.

but if the intrest rate rises NEE will be forced to stop growing as fast or cut their dividend making the 90 dollar share comedown significantly.

the company looks highly indebt, highly valued,  slow growth compaired with other industrys, and highly in risk but with the 180 billion dollar value of the company i feel like i am missing something but cant find what exactly."
939,2021-12-20 08:16:42,"The Case for $SRAD to hit $100 in 4 yearsTired of DKNG and PENN deep dives? Here's a stock pick and analysis we like.

**Summary:**

* Demonstrates ability to create profits for investors in a market not known for its get-rich-quick profitability.
* Out-performing sector companions in heavily hit market
* Growing at 30% YoY while increasing margin.
* P/S Ratio of 8.3x created purely by market conditions and not fundamentals.
* Global market leader, poised to profit from US, Canada, India, Brazil and China legalization.
* $1bn available to fund growth.

$SRAD’s stock is at $17.70 and has been mostly dropping week on week from an opening of $27 - that's a 34% decline. In market cap terms, $SRAD has decreased from $8bn to $5.23bn. But let’s first compare it to some of its market companions:

$GENI – down 66% from a high of $22.27 in last 3 months

$DKNG – down 55% from a high of $63.39 in last 3 months

$PENN - down 63% from a high of $130 in the last 12 months

KAMBI.ST – down 56% from a high of SEK 518 in last 6 months

$BETZ – down 27% from $32.06 in last three months

So why has $SRAD stock held up relative to its four other market companions? It seems to have less to do with $SRAD and more to do with the market in general and the woes of the competitor stocks individually.

*Let's take a closer look.*

For instance, $GENI posted a disastrous Q3 EPS loss.

$DKNG will miss their 2021 revenue guidance and are being short-sold after various investigations.

$PENN are struggling with earnings misses and haven’t integrated brick and mortar with online

KAMBI.ST haven’t yet recovered from Covid? Not sure…

$BETZ, a Roundhill ETF serving as a barometer of the gambling stocks market, is weighed down by the poor performance of one of its biggest stocks $DKNG, but also $PENN, $CHDN, ENT and FLTR even though some gaming, casino and igaming stocks have held firm (e.g. $RSI), limiting the decline a little.

In contrast, in the meantime, $SRAD have signed or renewed deals with UEFA, Fanduel, ITF and the NBA. Q3’s earnings were seen as positive with almost all analyst coverage sticking with the $28.11 Price target average and $29.27 at SA . The NFL lost deal is not in play here as this news was public knowledge in April, a full five months before IPO.

There are three main assumptions on how $SRAD is going to make its way up to $100 ($29.5bn market cap) over the next four years.

**1) The market will correct:**

The market for gambling stocks looks like a gamble itself at the moment. It's in a perplexing state of freefall, like a gambler stuck on a losing streak. However, combined with other sectors such as low-medium tech on the NASDAQ, the 40% baseline decrease is seen as completely reversible with no change to any fundamentals. Simply put, $SRAD’s price will bounce to $30 with no news and/or solid future quarterlies. If $SRAD was trading at $30, $100 would seem a more reachable destination rather than a trip to *crazy town*.

**2) The market and $SRAD’s expected CAGR brings $SRAD’s stock price to $74 by 2025 (with continued EBITDA growth)**

The US GGR CAGR is predicted to be 47% for ‘20-25 meaning a GGR take of $10bn by 2025. To quote Morgan Stanley: “Gaming space already has a number of players, but if SRAD can achieve even a small sliver of the market, I believe this represents healthy upside to our long-term revenue forecasts.” Data providers supposedly achieve a maximum of 5% of GGR and say $SRAD has a 40% market share (commonly quoted), this would be $200m. If RoW GGR will be $190bn (estimates vary from $150bn to $400bn), $SRAD will take 40% of 1.5% (as GGR share is less accepted), that’s another $1.14bn. When we consider current revenues of $630m which are heavily diversified as seen in their earnings report, we can estimate a revenue of close to $2bn by 2025. That’s a CAGR of 26% which is easily achievable based on current YoY growth of 30%.

At $2bn and a 11x P/S multiple, we have a $22bn market cap and a stock price of $74.

SA has $SRAD’s revenue for 2022 at $774m which is 21%. If we compound $630m at 21% for 4 years, that’s $1.3bn. Even at an 8x multiple, that’s a market cap of $10.4bn and a stock price of $35. So where is the risk?

**3) The upside, making moves and surprising estimates earlier than scheduled**

The path to $75 by 2025 is set with conservative estimates regarding TAM of GGR, though at the bullish end of market share (40%). But if $SRAD can get to $1bn revenue quicker than forecast, say in 2022, their launching pad will be far higher. $1bn in 2022 (58% increase from 2022) leaves 44% CAGR to achieve $3bn 2025 revenue which will bring about the $100 stock price. Some catalysts include: Legalization of sports betting in China, California, India, Brazil, Florida, Texas in that order. But what if $SRAD decides to move into B2C? What if $SRAD take on ESPN with a profitable model? How about M&A to capture a new market or region? If they risk big as DKNG did initially, the payoff clears the path to $100.

$SRAD recently released their Q3 Earnings and it made for good reading:

· Revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased 30% to $158.7 million

· 2021E Revenue guidance $642.5m ($630m currently) and AEBITDA of $116m

· Q3 Free Cash Flow $37m (+144%)

· Total liquidity available as of 30th September 2021 - $1.02bn (from IPO, debt and profits)

· U.S. revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 119% - $56.3 million in first nine months

· Strong Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate of 128% at the end of third quarter of 2021

**Risks**:

The bear case for $SRAD involves them trading at a 5X multiple and not 11-15x (currently 8.3x). This will be due to slowed CAGR of 15% which will have been caused by a slowdown in legalizations or even a complete lack of legalizations. Unlikely. And there are no indications of a bear reversal in $SRAD fundamentals.

Unlike some companies, $SRAD talk openly about the risks which could materially harm their business. However, their 2020 numbers show they are Covid-proof since they actually increased revenue and EBITDA in 2020 and more so in 2021.

One obvious risk is that due to the factors outlined in their F1-filing, they lose market to competitors such as $GENI. The NFL loss proved $SRAD is susceptible to failures but the pattern didn’t continue as $SRAD have won the next four since.

**Summary:**

$SRAD is going to be a meal ticket for years to come. There's a pattern here. It has been returning profits to investors since 2008 or so says their earnings report! $100 a share belies a $29.5bn market cap and thus a P/E ratio of 14.75x at $2bn. It is certainly speculative but there is little downside for a company at $17.70 and P/S ratio of 8.3x and revenues of $630m when there are no discernible changes from the IPO at $27, market cap of $7.98bn and P/S of 12.7x. Even at an AEBITDA multiple of 40x, $SRAD is a value proposition compared to the largely unprofitable sports betting industry.

Disclosure: I am not a financial advisor, invest at your own risk. I maintain a position in $SRAD – 227 shares, average cost at $20.22 and intend to DCA back up to $40."

I have bought shares on Webull on margin. When learning about margin maintenance, it appears that I have some room with my TQQQ maintenance.

When I looked at my FNGU margin maintenance, I was a bit confused and appears that I'm already expected to be on margin call? I just bought 78 shares on margin on Friday for 34.57 per share. The margin maintenance states that I have to maintain 2705.04. If I divide 2705.04 by 78, I get 34.68 which is more than what I paid for. If I understand correctly, I should expect a margin call right?

One of my biggest holdings in the main portfolio is Nvdia with close to 20%. The overall return of it is 100%, with some of the first lots having +300% return. Why didn't i sell them until now ? Because i'm the boring kind of guy that just wanna buy and hold for as long as possible, as long as i still like and believe in the company. And i do really still believe in the future of Nvdia. I know it's stupid that i don't really have a plan to when i should sell (10%, 25%, 50% etc) and take some profits. So the last couple of weeks made me think again. Is it stupid that i still hold it with 100% return on it, even though i fully believe in the future of the company ? 

My thoughts are: should i sell some of it (i'm presonally thinking of selling and leave my inital investment in) ? Or how much of it would you sell ? Everything would go into VOO. This is also because i wanna grow the percentage i allocate to the ETFs. 

Any opinions on this is really appreciated guys. Thank you!"

Something I've been thinking about lately is Reddit going Public. 

A big reason companies IPO is to cash out or sellout to become billionaires*.  Usually the company grows and becomes worth a lot more, however the platform changes dramatically.  The once private company, then focuses on the balance sheet and pinches pennies and pushes revenue boosting tactics.  

Take Facebook or YouTube as an example.  Facebook was a decent social networking platform before they became public.  Also, didn't use predatorial tactics to keep our attention before.  I remember when I could watch videos on YouTube for hours... Now google wants to show us videos they want us to watch.  

I've watched Reddit also change the past couple years. 

I'm disappointed like your dads disappointment.

It is priced at this level because investors believe earnings will continue to grow very quickly. If earnings don't continue to grow substantially YoY, the stock will tank.

However, Nvidia faces a perfect storm in 2022 that will likely severely impact their earnings:

- Eth3reum is scheduled to go proof of stake in H1 2022. This means that millions of GPUs, no longer capable of earning a profit in excess of electricity costs will hit the secondary market and undercut prices of new GPUs.

- Intel is rumored to introduce their new dedicated GPUs in H1 2022, which will compete with Nvidia on the low to mid end.

- Rising interest rates in general are likely to have an impact on growth stocks.

- AMD's upcoming GPUs are rumored to be 3x as fast as their current generation flagship. If these rumors turn out to be true, Nvidia's dominance in the industry is threatened.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., WVa.), said the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better social spending and climate change bill is a “no” as far as he is concerned.

The centrist Democrat told Fox News Sunday he “cannot vote to continue with this peice of legislation.” The bill, which Senate Democrats had hoped to pass by Christmas, stalled last week after prolonged negotiations between Manchin and President Joe Biden.

“I’ve tried everything humanly possible,” Manchin said Sunday. “I can’t get there.”

The comments were certain to provoke a backlash by progressive members of the party, who wanted to bundle the social spending plan with the already enacted plan to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure to ensure its passage.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) told CNN on Sunday he would push to bring Build Back Better to a vote in the Senate, to force Manchin to explain to the public why he opposed it. “If he doesn’t have the courage to do the right thing for the working familiies of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world,” Sanders told CNN.

The bill, which the House already passed, includes spending on childcare, early education, and child tax credits. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices, expand Medicare and push for investments in clean energy, among other initiatives.

Last week, Biden conceded the Senate would likely push consideration for the bill into the new year after trying to convince Manchin to support it. Manchin has balked at the dollar amount of the spending and some provisions such as paid family leave, saying the spending would add to the deficit at a time when consumers are already paying higher prices for food, fuel and other household needs.

“This is a no on this legislation,” Manchin said."

The way I see it this drastically harms individual investors not even just retail investors, It would harm even individual accredited investors. 1 person can not be awake 24 hours. In the current system 1 individual investor may not have the same advanced algorithms or knowledge about sectors or single companies but has the same numbers of hours to react to market events as a Family Office, Hedge Fund or Investment Firm in the Stock Market. 24 hour trading would hand an insurmountable advantage to FOs and HFs etc etc as they have the budgets to break up to the 24 trading session into three 8 hour or four 6 hour periods for example and hire teams of people to work analyzing the market and doing everything that occurs during a normal trading day. If there is going to be radical changes to financial markets then the most sensible first step is to have 7 day trading every day.

New to investing this year, and I currently have all my holdings set to reinvest dividends into each investment. I have recently received dividends from many of my investments to end the year, so the price per share for those holdings went down to compensate for the payouts. 

After the transactions, my investments are still worth the same, but my cost basis for each has increased so my account is showing a much smaller gain overall for my investments (despite a larger net gain in value over the year).

For example, the importance of not chasing IV and picking a solid underlying for selling options (*cough* DKNG *cough*). I've read several investment books (Stock market wizard, how to make money in stocks, etc) and felt confident I knew what I was doing. At a market fundamental level, I think this is all a house of cards and that stock moves are largely arbitrary, but I see the graphs keep going up and to the right and suffer FOMO. At the same time I find this all incredibly interesting.

On Thursday market open, I purchased 70 shares of TQQQ (to add to 30 I already had) at ~167 with a stop limit of 149, based on the daily lows from the previous week. I had done so because the previous day Powell did not announce rate hikes and there was a huge rally. I thought the rally would continue and it would finally be the Santa Rally CNBC and reddit posters kept promising. 

Pre-market I saw that it was already decreasing, but my opinion until this was that pre-market is only used for market sentiment manipulation and that more often than not, a big reversal follows.

As most of us know, tech got hammered that day and TQQQ closed near 150. I held my position. Here's where I realized some fun about stops. They don't trigger pre-market, so you get to watch your position slowly, painfully drag below your stop. This is what happened Friday.

I lost about $2k (out of ~50k balance) from entirely preventable circumstances.

I feel angry and slightly humiliated. I know I can figure this out but I got greedy and paid the price.

This lesson cost me $2k so please enjoy this advice for free. I wish I looked at the pre-market hourly chart and it would have been abundantly obvious how Thursday was going to turn out. If I decided to stick with it, that I picked a higher stop. I wish I would stay away from leveraged ETFs until I know what I'm doing and can show consistent profit. If you let greed take over and try to get rich quick, you will ignore signals and lose money.

For example, ROKU, SQ, DDOG all have >300. Why is that? 

Is it just a signal that the market has really high growth expectations for these companies, or is there something more going on that I'm missing? I'm a rookie at this so apologies if it's a naive question. I was reading how Michael Burry was shorting Tesla because of being overvalued, but then again Tesla's multiple is 175 so seeing that DDOG has 1000 really made me question what the multiple really is."

Let's say I wanted to buy some Walmart but only have 50 on each app, can i get portions of the stock on each and tranfer to what I want to main as an account? And will it equal out as a full share instead of a portion. 

Furthermore, where is the best place to learn that isn't locked behind a subscription service?"

Who doesn't love mythology? Greek, Egyptian, Norse, there are plenty. Recently this sub has seen a new rise of modern mythology. Apparently, everything is already priced in and the market is some all-knowing, all-seeing entity. Is this true? Maybe. Let's dive in.

The origin of the mythos.

Sorry, I'm too lazy to try and figure this out. My guess is that it started with some brilliant guru who spouted this during one of his Youtube Ad videos. It seems awfully convenient, doesn't it. ""The market knows all. You think you can beat the big banks? Of course not. They have a million analysts and you don't stand a chance. However, follow me and the trades I'll email you every day, and you too can become a millionaire in a year or two."" Let's face it, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

The fallacy of the mythos.

""Everything is already priced in."" Let's explore the consequences. Two companies go public with news of their merger. Price of both stocks stay the same. Barely a wrinkle. Why? There were already some rumors so it was priced in. 

You deep dive a company and discover that their growth is accelerating. If this keeps up, the share price is somewhat undervalued at this moment. You compare this with the prices of said companies competitors and discover they are all overvalued. Do you invest? No. The market knows all, so I must be missing something right?

The FED announcing to hike interest rates. All growth stocks drop drastically as everyone migrates risky parts of their portfolio to big, solid companies with decent dividend. Rumors grow that Evergrande might default, every price is speculative and that this is the new way of the market. Then you read it, ""Bullish! This is all already priced in."" Of course. You're such an simpleton. How could you miss this?! All the potential disasters are priced in. 

If you truly believe this, then all price mutations are random. People are randomly selling and buying stuff and you just need luck. Ask yourself, do you really believe that?

Sweet reality

Meanwhile in the normal world, some things are priced in, but not everything is. News of the omicron variant caused prices to drop. Evergrande caused prices to drop. Earnings reports cause a drop or rise. That's just how it is.

The market still responds to every tidbit of news. So if your deep dive uncovers something, it's most likely true. There are thousands of companies who release their earnings report and hundred of small news articles that give information about very niche topics. There is no group of people who read all of that and have the means to immediately capitalize on it before everyone else.

People are emotional when it comes to money and also to stocks. For most people here, a ""crash"" is a 2,5% drop. Investing has only recently been made available to everyone. Apps where you can easily buy any stock you like, weren't available in 2008. When the real crash comes (no one knows when and how) then it will be worse than 2008. A lot more individual investors will panic, since they've never seen their portfolio tank 50% and see headlines that this might be bankruptcy for whatevery company they have invested in.

When you do a deep dive and uncover a good buy, just buy it and then post it if you want to share. Since you did the deep dive, you know more than 99,9% of all redditors on the company. You might even be the most knowledgable if the company is in a niche.

So do your deep dives into markets you know. Feel free to share your findings with us and try to think critically of all comments, no matter the amount of upvotes."

I can see mass exodus to fuboTV.

Market cap just over 2B on 150m/quarter revenue. Seems like a pretty good growth stock, especially with more people converting to streaming.

Good play to buy on Monday or priced in?"
