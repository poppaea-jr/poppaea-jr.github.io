<h3>Does Social Media Influence the Stock Market?</h3>
      
<p>To assess this question, I will perform a Sentiment Analysis on online posts, and compare how these vary over time to fluctuations in the S&P 500 index. I chose to collect my text data from Reddit because it makes it's data particularly accessible through the Python Reddit API Wrapper.</p>

<div class="chart" id="chart21">
  <script>     var myChart21 = "charts/stocks_Polarity.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart21', myChart21);

<p>The initial challenge I faced was that the timeframe of posts cannot be specified in a fetch using standard PRAW, and it will only pull around 900 posts per run. I therefore switched to Pushshift PRAW, however this API was limited to 100 posts per run. I circumvented this using a loop. An example of this notebook, including outputs for one day, can be found <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/Example_Notebook_PRAW_Loop.ipynb"> in my Github here</a>. After fetching the posts, the notebook uses TextBlob to assign a polarity value to each,  1 being entirely positive, and -1 being entirely negative. Due to the large amount of data being processed, I chose to run this loop for 1 month intervals, and then merge them <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e7s4wn46n7bbQA3g5V2wuPUlwEoeInXr?usp=sharing">in Pandas,</a> see the code <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/november.ipynb">in Github</a>.</p>

<!-- Time series chart of sentiment polarity -->

<p>As my aim was to test whether the sentiment displayed in the forum over time influences changes in the market over time. I chose to perform a Granger Causality test, with the null hypothesis that sentiment is not useful in predicting the S&P 500 Index. In order to perform this test, both of my time series needed to be stationary.</p>

<!-- Time series chart of sentiment polarity - now stationary -->

<p>Predictably, the series for S&P 500 Index Values was not stationary. After a log transformation and first-differencing, the series satisfied a Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity: see the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1361n5kxDiiUatZiXa6N78e4GwuYZovzq?usp=sharing"> Colab notebook.</a></p>

<p> To compare the sentiment of these posts to the performance of the stock market overall, I chose to consider the closing prices of the S&P500, both because it is an index and because about half of Reddit's users are from US. As I'm particularly interested in how online sentiment creates changes in the stock market, I calculated the percentage changes in this<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gjyODYkXdZDXh5aABt-9P6aRxgJhkHfq?usp=sharing"> colab notebook</a>.</p>

  </script>
</div>

<!--Chart 21 - first sentiment polarity -->

<p>I then performed some data processing in Stata for the largest possible dataset for r/stocks (982 text posts), in order to find the daily average polarity score, the code for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/daily_polarity.do">here</a>.</p>

<p>In order to compare variations in sentiment with those in the market, I computed the percentage changes in sentiment between days against the same for the S&P500 index, in the following <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1olLnjS3A79EPddlX6vA_BRsR3GQCT6Iv?usp=sharing">Colab notebook.</a></p>

<p>The S&P time series for the time period I considered only required first differencing to reach stationarity, see the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1on3DUZ9Cl-rJkkyHkp80oRrUaIr_zgXS?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a>.</p>
