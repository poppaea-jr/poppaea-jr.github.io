<h3>Does Social Media Influence the Stock Market?</h3>
      
<p>To assess this question, I will perform a Sentiment Analysis on online posts, and compare how these vary over time to fluctuations in the S&P 500 index. I chose to collect my text data from Reddit because it makes it's data particularly accessible through the Python Reddit API Wrapper.</p>

<div class="chart" id="chart21">
  <script>     var myChart21 = "charts/stocks_Polarity.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart21', myChart21);
  </script>
</div>

<p>The above chart shows my first data pull for this project, the code for which can be found<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A2LFGAsgmIev6hK05JuAApSLtGbLKhd5?usp=sharing"> in the colab notebook</a> or <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/stocks_fetch_and_pol.ipynb">on github</a>.
The challenge I faced here was that the timeframe of posts cannot be specified in a fetch using standard PRAW, and it will only pull around 900 posts per run. I therefore switched to Pushshift PRAW, however this API was limited to 100 posts per run. I circumvented this using a loop. An example of this notebook, including outputs for one day, can be found <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/Example_Notebook_PRAW_Loop.ipynb"> in my Github here</a>. After fetching the posts, the notebook uses TextBlob to assign a polarity value to each,  1 being entirely positive, and -1 being entirely negative. Due to the large amount of data being processed, I chose to run this loop for 1 month intervals, and then merge them <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e7s4wn46n7bbQA3g5V2wuPUlwEoeInXr?usp=sharing">in Pandas,</a> see the code <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/merging_months.ipynb">in Github</a>.
Once I had collected data for the whole year, I collapsed it to daily values in Stata, see the <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/sentiment_data_collapse.do">Do file here</a>. I converted the dates to be Vega friendly in colab, and plotted the years time series below:</p>

<!-- Time series chart of sentiment polarity and sp -->

<div class="chart" id="chart22">
  <script>     var myChart22 = "charts/sentiment_time_series.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart22', myChart22);
  </script>
</div>

<p>As my aim was to test whether the sentiment displayed in the forum over time influences changes in the market over time. I chose to perform a Granger Causality test, with the null hypothesis that sentiment is not useful in predicting the S&P 500 Index. In order to perform this test, both of my time series needed to be stationary.</p>

<p>Predictably, the series for S&P 500 Index Values was not stationary, and required first-differencing: see the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1361n5kxDiiUatZiXa6N78e4GwuYZovzq?usp=sharing"> Colab notebook</a>, or view the code <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/yfin_stationarity.ipynb">on Github</a>.</p>

<div class="chart" id="chart31">
  <script>     var myChart31 = "charts/stationary_sp.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart31', myChart31);
  </script>
</div>

<p>My time series for sentiment already appeared stationary according to a Dickey Fuller test, <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/sentiment_stationarity.ipynb">see the code</a>.</p>

<p>Post their transformations, both series have a p-value less than 0.000 in a Dickey Fuller test with the null hypothesis of non-stationarity, indicating that the chance of this series occuring if the underlying variable is stationary is less than 0.1%. I therefore interpreted this as them being stationary, and therefore progressed to the Granger test.</p>

<p>An extended version of my S&P fetch, which indludes this Granger test, can be found<a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/Granger_test.ipynb"> on my Github</a>. The smallest final p-value in the final Granger causation matrix was 0.2723, too large to reject the null hypothesis and therefore conclusing that sentiment in r/stocks does not cause changes in the S&P 500 index.</p>

<p>Already, work is being done involving opinion dynamics in automated trading, but perhaps data such as I have collected from Reddit is most applicable cases such as cryptocurrencies and the Gamestop short squeeze. Looking at a market index such as the S&P 500, It would be interesting to look at a wider base of text data, such as what is happening in the news, and Twitter.</p>

<p> To compare the sentiment of these posts to the performance of the stock market overall, I chose to consider the closing prices of the S&P500, both because it is an index and because about half of Reddit's users are from US. As I'm particularly interested in how online sentiment creates changes in the stock market, I calculated the percentage changes in this<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gjyODYkXdZDXh5aABt-9P6aRxgJhkHfq?usp=sharing"> colab notebook</a>.</p>

<!--Chart 24 - first sentiment polarity -->
<div class="chart" id="chart24">
  <script>     var myChart24 = "charts/SP_Pct_Chn.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart24', myChart24);
  </script>
</div>

<!--Chart 21 - first sentiment polarity -->

<p>I then performed some data processing in Stata for the largest possible dataset for r/stocks (982 text posts), in order to find the daily average polarity score, the code for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/poppaea-jr/poppaea-jr.github.io/blob/main/daily_polarity.do">here</a>.</p>
<!--Chart 27 - first sentiment polarity -->
<div class="chart" id="chart27">
  <script>     var myChart27 = "charts/daily_r_stocks.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart27', myChart27);
  </script>
</div>

<p>In order to compare variations in sentiment with those in the market, I computed the percentage changes in sentiment between days against the same for the S&P500 index, in the following <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1olLnjS3A79EPddlX6vA_BRsR3GQCT6Iv?usp=sharing">Colab notebook.</a></p>

<!--Chart 28 - first sentiment polarity -->
<div class="chart" id="chart28">
  <script>     var myChart28 = "charts/sen_pol.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart28', myChart28);
  </script>
</div>



<p> </p>
<div class="chart" id="chart30">
  <script>     var myChart30 = "charts/aug_jan.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart30', myChart30);
  </script>
</div>

<p>The S&P time series for the time period I considered only required first differencing to reach stationarity, see the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1on3DUZ9Cl-rJkkyHkp80oRrUaIr_zgXS?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a>.</p>

<div class="chart" id="chart32">
  <script>     var myChart32 = "charts/2021_stat_sp.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart32', myChart32);
  </script>
</div>

<p>(This chart has polarity scores for the last month (08/12/2021 - 08/01/2022), but the loop took around 2 hours to run. See the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXVo8NEg0AIMauVrTx4TkMDASwHuXQ9B?usp=sharing">Colab notebook.</a>)</p>
<!--Chart 29 - first sentiment polarity -->

    vegaEmbed('#chart29', myChart29);
