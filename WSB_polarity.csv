**International Macro**

1. Fed minutes: earlier or faster rate hikes may be necessary, tapering could be faster than last cycle

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes document of the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting. The minutes show that participants noted that, given the outlook for the economy, labor market and inflation, it may be necessary to raise the federal funds rate earlier or at a faster pace than previously expected.

The minutes show that most participants believe that if the recent pace of improvement in the labor market continues, the conditions for a rate increase could be met relatively soon.

Given rising inflationary pressures and a stronger labor market, participants believed that the increase in policy accommodation associated with the current pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary. Participants noted that the Committee should continue to be prepared to adjust the pace of bond purchases if the economic outlook changes.

2. The United States ""small non-farm"" monthly increase of more than 800,000 more than twice the analysts expected

On Wednesday (January 5), the U.S. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) announced that private sector employment grew by more than 800,000, the largest increase in nearly seven months.

ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in the report that December's job growth brought the average number of jobs in the fourth quarter of last year to 625,000, exceeding the average number of jobs in 2021 by 514,000.

Although the number of new jobs in 2021 exceeded 6 million, private sector employment is still nearly 4 million less than the level before the new crown virus.

3. U.S. poll: Biden's approval rating fell to a new low of 44%, 70% of respondents think the U.S. is on the wrong path

Newsweek said Biden had the support of most Americans in his first months in office, but his approval rating has been in decline since the end of August 2021.

Biden is facing an equally tricky new year - including the Democrats' attempt to pass the $1.75 trillion ""Rebuild a Better Future"" bill and other issues that remain unresolved.

4. U.S. Markit services, composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, input prices hit a record high

Data released on Wednesday showed that the U.S. Markit services and composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, and the related price sub-indexes all hit a record high. Compared to the manufacturing data released this week, the service sector appears to be more robust.

Analysis says that the current U.S. business activity is mainly driven by the service sector, manufacturing production growth rate is relatively slow.

5. The British government to cancel the new crown test requirements for travelers entering England before the line

Local time on January 5, the British government announced that from the 7th, abandoned the previously implemented measures requiring travelers entering the England region to be tested for the new crown virus before travel, only requiring travelers to be tested within two days of arrival in England.

6. Winter power supply tensions France considers liberalizing coal power station restrictions

The French Ministry of Environmental Protection said to the public that the French government is considering relaxing restrictions on coal power stations in January and February due to tight winter power supply, but this will not change the decision that France will eventually shut down coal power stations.

7. The European Central Bank management Kazaks: early 2023 interest rate hike is a ""possible scenario""

ECB Governing Councilor Kazaks said the ECB is ready to raise interest rates and cut stimulus if necessary. He said the ECB will act if the outlook for inflation is high and a rate hike in early 2023 is a ""likely scenario"".

8. Chilean lawmakers asked the court to terminate 400,000 tons of lithium mine contract tender

Chilean lawmakers applied to the House of Representatives for an injunction aimed at preventing the outgoing government from accepting bids for a lithium mining contract. Chile announced last October that it was offering five 80,000-ton quotas to domestic and overseas companies for a total of 400,000 tons of exploration and production contracts, with the winning bidder to receive seven years of exploration and development projects and 20 years of production, with bids due to end in mid-January.

**Company News**

1. The big short-seller who sang Wirecard's praises years in advance thinks Tesla shares are 10 times overvalued

Fraser Perring, who accused German payment processor Wirecard AG of fraud years before its collapse, is betting that Tesla's straight-up valuation will come back down to earth.

The founder of Viceroy Research tweeted Wednesday that there is a ""stock price mismatch"" between Tesla and veteran automakers Toyota and Volkswagen.

The two largest automakers delivered about 10 to 11 times as much as Tesla last year, but Tesla's market value under Musk is $1.15 trillion, more than twice the combined market value of Toyota and Volkswagen.

2. Sources said Meta stopped developing VR/AR operating system, ""independent and autonomous"" plan setback

Facebook parent company Meta Platforms has reportedly stopped developing a new software operating system, two people familiar with the matter said today.

The system was designed primarily for its virtual reality (VR) devices and upcoming augmented reality (AR) glasses.

The operating system project had been underway for several years and involved hundreds of employees. Analysts say the project is on hold, meaning Meta's attempt to take control of its Oculus VR headset, as well as the underlying software for future augmented or mixed reality (MR) devices, has suffered a setback.

2022-01-06 04:30:13,"We’re all about to get royally fuckedAs a surgical resident at a major city hospital, I suspect the CDC knows everyone is going to get omicron in the next 2-4 weeks. 

*The CDC reduced the recommended quarantine for asymptomatic Covid positive healthcare worker to 5 days REGARDLESS OF A NEW POSITIVE COVID TEST without citing sufficient evidence justifying the move.* The CDC and the AHA just said that doctors should not delay CPR to put on PPE on known COVID patients. Every doctor I know is completely confused why they’d do this. Fuck the healthcare workers I guess

But if everyone is going to get Covid anyways on the next few weeks, risking additional exposure doesn’t matter. 

If the whole country gets Covid in a 2-3 week span, we are FUCKED. What if there are no essential workers? What if hospitals lose what little staff we have already? 

They want people back at work as soon as possible to minimize what will be the greatest acute labor crisis in history. A busy Walmart nearby closed a whole week for “cleaning”, but it’s likely because too many employees are out with Covid. Groceries, pharmacies, business, critical infrastructure , healthcare, everything is going to get hit HARD and FAST. 

Hospitals are fucking dying right now and the worst is yet to come.. My hospital has been diverting patient to other hospitals, which are also literally all on divert, therefore no one is on divert. We have the physical rooms but not the staff to cover the rooms. If we lose any more staff, dermatologists will start intubating and managing vents (but kind of actually). People will fucking die from lack of medical care. 

Do whatever you need to do to protect your assets or make a lot of 🌈🐻 money in this market. Don’t ask me what to do, my portfolio bleeds almost as much as my patients. 

TLDR: We are going to face the biggest and fastest labor shortage in history in the next 3-4 weeks

Side note: please don’t go to the hospital if you’re positive unless you’re in a high risk group or are short of breath (edit: or have concerning symptoms). There’s nothing the hospital will do for you healthy young adults except stick you with a $3,000 bill unless you need oxygen. Call your doctor instead, though they’ll probably get Covid as well.

*reposted to correct title

Edit: typo, but also to clarify, it doesn’t matter if it’s more mild if people are still out of work for that period. Omicron has a third of the hospitalization rate, but I cannot emphasize enough how infectious this thing is. Look at [these carts](https://imgur.com/a/cbQY4Pn)

Edit 2: most controversial post on Reddit in the last hour! I want to emphasize that omicron is more mild, but if people are still quarantining with mild symptoms at the same time, there will be a major labor crisis. This argument, along with the CDC’s decision to reduce quarantine to 5 days, technically supports re opening (with reasonable precautions).",0.08633445423623995,2923,505

*Company Overview:*

$MMM – 3M Inc. is a global, diversified technology company that operates in the following businesses: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3M develops their products in -house, and thus has an unusually high product development, and research and development costs.

3M operates in 4 main business segments, which include: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. These business segments appear on some of their quarterly and annual financial reports, and their performance in each of these segments will be discussed later.

***Investment Information:***

*Recent SEC Filings:*

In this section, I will summarize 3M’s most recent SEC filings to help you get an idea of what is currently going on in their business.

· SpinCo Merger (Reverse Morris Trust Transaction) 8-K Report:

o On December 13th, 2021, 3M sold one of their subsidiary companies (“SpinCo. Corp.”) to Neogen (one of their subsidiary companies “Nova Sub Inc.)

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· **$HON – Honeywell International:** Honeywell International.is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. Its Aerospace segment offers several electronics, software, physical parts, and power units to their clientele in the aviation business. Honeywell’s Building Technologies segment offers applications software, switches, and electronics that assist in the building and construction industries.

The company's Power segment offers gas turbines for utilities, power producers, and industrial applications; steam power technology (boilers, generators etc.); and reactor technologies. This segment services may industries, such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals, test systems, and water. GE’s Renewable Energy segment provides various solutions for onshore and offshore wind, blades, hydro, storage, solar, and grid solutions, and hybrid renewables.

Its Aerospace Systems segment offers products for use in commercial and military airframe and engine programs, fuel systems and components, pilot controls, and wheels/brakes.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, 3M’s net sales essentially remained constant, however, they were able to decrease their operating expense by 3.6%, which helped to contribute to a higher operating income and a higher operating margin. Additionally, 3M was able to increase their net income in 2020 by 18% which is very high, and their EPS ended the year at $9.32 (up from 2019’s EPS of $7.92).

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, 3M’s Transportation and Electronic segment’s revenues decreased by 8% and represents their only declining segment. However, within these segments the Abrasives, Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Oral Care performed the worst, declining 15%, 17%, 16%, and 19% respectively.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net income by 0.3%, which might not sound good, however, considering 3M’s operating income decreased in this time period any increase in net income is great. Furthermore, 3M was able to keep their EPS (basic and diluted) constant during this time, which is again good considering their decline in operating income.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net sales by 7% YoY, now you may be wondering “how is this bad”? Well, during this same period, 3M increased their operating expenses by 11%, which contributes to a lower operating margin. This can be seen by their YoY decline in operating income of 6%

· **Share Repurchasing:** In the first 3 quarters of 2021 (Jan 1 – September 30th), 3M reported repurchasing 6,675,484 at an average cost basis of $190.88/share (totalling $1.27B worth of shares repurchased). This would have increased the value of existing shares by approximately 1.2%, which is a great sign for longer term investors.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing 3M’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following:

*PE Ratio:*

Based off of 3M’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $MMM should be valued at $232.72/share, which would imply a share price increase of 29%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/B Ratio:*

3M’s P/B ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $143.52/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 20%. This is a little low and contradicts the results achieved via the P/E comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

3M’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $174.82/share, which would translate into a small downside of 3%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Based off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $183.69/share, which would imply an increase of 2%. This indicates that 3M is very close to their fair value.

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $MMM stock of $205/share, which implies a potential upside to this investment of 14%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that 3M is sitting at/around their fair value and has a little bit of room to run up.

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with 3M’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find 3M’s fair value to be $203/share, which implies an upside of 13%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that 3M is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $MMM stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $MMM stock of $197/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $MMM stock would go as follows:

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $180/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially the 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual) reports).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking). If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",0.09265364005912784,11453,1693

Today we finally saw the dip we were looking for to confirm that SPY will (most likely) see a large dip before we reach ATH again.

Todays dip brought the price down to close at 468.38. Why is that important? Well throughout these dips this week the stock always managed to recover and close above the 5 day EMA and the 20 day EMA... until today. 

This closed the candle below the 20 day EMA of 470.4... historically looking back whenever SPY closed a candle below the 20 day it usually bounces near the 100 day EMA which is 455.2

The same applies to the daily bollinger bands. We had been bouncing off the mid bollinger and closing above it until today. We saw a close below the kid bollinger of 469.81... in general the price usually finds support near the lower bollinger band which is also near 457.15

Daily RSI is in a downward trend and the daily MACD is going to cross over to sell very soon. 

All of this brings me to the conclusion we will see 455 very soon... it should also be noted that there is a support line that perfectly runs along 455 which we saw SPY bounce off on 12/20/21, 10/6/21, 10/4/22, 10/30/2020, and 5/4/2020... yes this support line is almost a year and a half old. 

I am anticipating a sideways/ slight recovery and rest day tomorrow that should see a retest and rejection near that 20 day EMA before we close our 2nd candle below it.",0.05405895691609977,1516,281

My gains.  

Associate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let’s not squander this opportunity.

**TLDR:** 

1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**
2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \*clinical\* data.**
3. &#x200B;

**Math Class:**

Stock price’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations

Thirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.

**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**

&#x200B;

**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**

For this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. 

Why did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: 

***""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.""*** 

Put simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  

But before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab’s results.

**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** 

On August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen’s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:

1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. 

2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. 

3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. 

4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.

5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.

I am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen’s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I’m probably not ;)).

**Need More Evidence?**

Below is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d

You will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.

**Still More Evidence:**

On November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, ""there are no signs of data manipulation."" SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. 

**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**

SAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.

[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:

 

https://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf

Ready?  Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. 

Now let’s look at SAVA:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)

SAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”** 

To reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.

**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**

There will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). 

SAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  

Other potential drivers of price action include:

* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)
* A float of less than 40 million.
* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)

All this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  

**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**

[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)

Why did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam’s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”

**Simufilam's data shows it is:** 

**1). Safe**

**2) Effective** 

**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** 

&#x200B;

**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**

It was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…

Long-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.

I must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  

***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** 

SAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.

**House cleaning:**

I spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, ""A Comprehensive Stock Analysis""](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). 

The Authors include

Clinical and Academic Neurologists, 

MDs, 

PhDs, 

PharmDs, 

Successful biotech investors 

An Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader

Through my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's ""headline hysteria"" usually means buying opportunities for them (“overreaction with reversion to the mean”).

SAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  

If you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).

**Did I mention SAVA’s historical data and Alzheimer’s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** 

With the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  

**Lastly:**

**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  

Anyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.

Gamestops closing price peaked 27th jan. Maths is tricky here so try pay attention.

 27 - 10.

Thats a 18 day difference. So here my wrinkle brain started formulating and came up with a conclusion many hours later. 

Gamestops price has a 18 day delay to Irish covid cases.   

Now looking at modern day:

Seeing as how the irish cases rally began roughly 21st December. We should expect positive price action starting roughly 10th january. I personally, am dumping all my savings in, which for a jam-making college student isnt much.

2022-01-05 21:33:59,"Short DD on Semler Scientific ($SMLR)Ever been to the doctor and had this inflatable thingie put around your arm? That is, apparently, how they try to determine whether your arteries are clogging with fat, and whether you are at risk for a myriad of severe conditions such as heart attacks. 

This company found a better, cheaper and quicker way; a clasp on your finger and on your toe, to measure it with electric impulses (or other magic). You’ll find Quora topics on it, with people recommending the service to each other(‘s grandmother). 

[Pure pleasure, apparently](https://preview.redd.it/fs89o5fdtx981.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d6cccc2d007f233f39f52dcb86a5ccb42b9c285)

It is a new, non-intrusive method, and they make money by charging a flat monthly fee and a fee-per-test. When a physician uses QuantoFlo, (s)he gets charged. Investors got their tits jacked after SMLR got uplisted from OTCQB to Nasdaq recently and with the company beating increasingly ambitious EPS targets ten times in a row. 

Then .. drama!

During the 1 Nov earnings call, they:

* Missed earnings at $14 instead of $15 million, 
* Missed EPS targets set by 3 (?) analysts by $0.19 per share, only reaching a net income of $0.51 per share, 
* Their gross profit margin went down from 92 to 90%, 
* They always said that their increase in operational costs will always be outpaced by their increase in revenue and that didn’t happen this time.

The stock price went from a close price of $149 to $111 in one day, and keeps trailing down, now at around $88. Why? Because they have a large P/E for their sector. Investors paid a premium expecting revenues to explode. Only 2 million Americans got tested and 80 million are guesstimated to be at risk. Hamburgers. 

When that didn’t happen a single time, they got spooked.

[Oops ..](https://preview.redd.it/7s7p4cl6tx981.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ae8a24ec32a71d35b3881044ad72faab385563)

**So what about it?**

I suggest listening to the earnings call. The CEO/CFO said that Omicron caused the variable income based on fee-per-test - so not the flat rate fees - to go down and/or ‘some kind of yet to be determined seasonality’. Revenue will nonetheless continue to go up YoY.

It is not hard to imagine that physicians had other priorities with the Omicron variant in full effect. Same thing happened for this company in 2020, before things picked up again in 2021 after the vaccine.

During this call, it was also announced that the company bought stakes in various private firms to bring to market more healthcare related products in different HCC code categories, meaning an even larger potential to increase revenue with new patients targeted. 

People smarter than me crunched the numbers and investment fund Opaleye Management bought in at $114 *after the crash*. For me the immediate upside, after a solid earnings call at the end of February is somewhere north of that figure. Give it some time, and it might bounce back to $149 and above.

The short float is about 1.65%, which makes me believe that the market does not think this will drop much further. 

Company has no debt and has a cash position of $35.9 million at 9/30/2021 vs. $22.1 million at the end of 2020. In the earnings call it was said that dilution is not in the cards.

**Catalysts?**

Earnings call in the first half of 2022, as these PAD tests are expected to be conducted sooner rather than later. Management noted that the healthcare offices don't want to be caught in the same position they were caught in 2020, where they were conducting tests moderately until everything shut down.

An announcement of the other products/services, as this is currently still on the hush-hush. The news that they already signed a first customer to a license for one of these new products got completely buried. 

**The bear case?** 

The P/E is still high at 32.1x after the drop, and there was insider selling by the CEO, just before the earnings call at the end of October. He unloaded 5000 shares for about $670.000.

\*

\* \*

TL;DR: This stock is not talked about on Reddit yet, and has an immediate upside of about 24% and 62% in the mid-term. Or I am an idiot, who is to say?

2022-01-05 21:33:01,"$GOEV Sitting well below moving averages - Crayon Eater AnalysisAfternoon, apes!

It's me, the resident $GOEV pumper.

After the November spike the share price of our wonderful bangbus manufactuer has been beaten into the ground, and all indicators point to a good entry price.

The best fit curves I can find are 14, 50, 75, and 100-day moving averages, as pictured below:

https://preview.redd.it/9z9agvv6mx981.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=efb1c9722cc626a40a6c2cd37cf5e57952bb2255

$GOEV is  a highly volatile stock with lots of short-selling that sees long declines in share price, then gaps upward quickly before starting the trend again.

Our turnaround prices in the past 10 months have been \~$7.15 and \~$6.50, with our all-time low around $5.80.

**Share Price Currently Sits @ $7.29, while moving averages indicate support for a run up to around $8-10.**

# The Play

* 1/14, 1/21, 1/28, $7.50c, $8c, $8.50c
* 1/28-2/18, basically any strike price under $10

Upcoming catalyst-  we should expect a Q4 2021 update on either 2/14 or 2/21.  I'll probably buy some 2/18s just on the hope that we get the call on the 14th and more good news.

My positions: 

* 1200 heavy shares.  I'm long GOEV and continue to average down.  I will be buying more shares while it's under $8.
* I will be putting out orders for 1/21, 1/28, and 2/18 targeting $7.50 and $8, but I may get some $9 or $10 if they're cheap enough.",0.23037037037037042,2032,258

I By no means have a crystal ball, but i would like to point out a few things that everyone should be thinking about when it comes to trying to make money in in 2022. 

1. Companies that live off of cheap debt are going to be crushed, examples: Doordash, and real estate companies - Zillow, and Blackstone. 
2. Banks are being handed a gift here, higher interest rates means banks can charge more in closing fees. Long WFC, BAC, MTB (they'll become for profitable, Revenues may reduce) 
3. Interest rates are rising, Which really means bond prices are falling. TYO, TTT and other short US treasury Etfs will absolutely kill it. 
4. Although all stock will likely take hits, Companies like MSFT, T, FB and other monsters that have taken out cheap loans in 2021 to repurchase stock in 2022 will likely fare better than the rest. (TSLA, NFLX are not a monster in this way.)  
5. Its also my opinion that 2022 will be the year the fundamentals start to actually matter again as money becomes more scarce. TXRH is a $72 stock max.

Essentially the Fed is opening the door to earlier rate hikes than initially expected and might begin reducing their asset holdings relatively soon. What this means is that interest rates will go higher earlier than initially expected and quantitative TIGHTENING will come into play as opposed to quantitative easing. This is where the Fed starts SELLING its tresaury bonds and MBS as opposed to buying them in order to reduce the M2 money supply.  

As for me, upon hearing this news I have decided to sell the vast majority of my stock positions and maximized my cash allocation. I see this as an opportunity to buy a lot of ITM SPY leaps on the cheap while delta hedging them with ATM SPY put monthlies. This way, if the markets are more bearish than I anticipated, my puts will give me a backdoor out of my trade and I can escape relatively unscathed.

Yah obviously I mean look at the chart lol. There might be more dump though, which is exactly what we want.

&#x200B;

# Nuts and bolts

In June 2021 HLGN closed a $83.4M round on a $750M valuation, at $10 those investors get 145% return, and only $27.7M of that $83.4M is locked up. ^(\[see page 268 and 272 of the S-4 filing\]) They will probably be taking profits on a risky play like this: SPAC with bloated valuation based on projected revenues five years from now.

In December 2020 they received a second Series A round at a $80M valuation; that round accounts for 19M shares, ^(\[see page 106 of the S-4 filing\]) all of those shares are available to sell and offer just those investors over 7x return (@$10/sh). They’re likely selling too.

HLGN is also in bad shape, they have $41.6M in cash, ^(\[see page 243 of the S-4 filing\]) but have significant cash burn projected for the next two years ($385M), ^(\[see page 149 of the S-4 filing\]) they received $188M from the SPAC, but still need an additional $155M which they will likely raise by selling hella shares.

&#x200B;

# Additional mechanics at play

There are two dynamics that can make this drop juicier.

The first is, as shares become available PIPE investors will be able to go short to protect their downside in their position.

There is another element to this. We’re all probably familiar with the delta hedging mechanic by now, basically the tail wags the dog. OTM options buying drives option sellers to hedge to avoid taking a position on the underlying security.

If people are piling into OTM calls, MMs will have to buy shares; likewise, if people are piling into OTM puts, MMs will have to sell shares -- exacerbating the situation. Hopefully what you get is a parabolic move. I’m hoping for a parabolic move downwards.

# Bill Gates

Look I’m sick of trying to format this shit but fucking Bill Gates is invested in this shit. ^(\[)[^(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001840292/000121390021036146/ea143939-425_athenatechno.htm)^(\]) Dude was also invested in ([trigger warning, u r the dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTKvngWnvDs)) Quantumscape (>$100/sh to $23/sh)  and more recently ESS Tech (\~$28/sh to \~$11/sh)

He allegedly [invented the coronavirus to sell fucking desktop computers i dunno](https://i.imgur.com/wgOQChw.png), it’s in all the newspapers [do some fucking reading for once](https://youtu.be/wCZmkBOYwH4?t=36). All I know is I got my booster shot and my ping is 1ms now.

He allegedly ([definitely](https://i.imgur.com/GsemZ4Z.png)) met [with a nasty fuck](https://i.imgur.com/80SRqrL.png).

Furthermore, everything this guy touches allegedly turns to fucking shit including his marriage.

Last but not least [he used to sleep with his shoes on to save time in the mornings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcsgZ122jrA). Not allegedly, there is [no doubt](https://i.imgur.com/fFFU2MD.png) in my mind that he did this, a #hustle-page post is all the DD I need.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

Long story short, HLGN may continue to dump and we can benefit:

* It got pumped because it was low float, actually it is high float and the float will continue to increase.
* Insiders will sell because their returns are already so good and the company will sell because they need money badly.
* Put buyers might cause MMs to delta hedge and create a parabolic move
* Bill Gates is like king midas if everything king midas touched was shit. He invested early and I allege that he wants to leave the retail investor with a big bag o shit

2022-01-05 19:35:17,"Undervalued Stock $GSI know, I know.  Someone is recommending a bank/financial services company.  Before you downvote, here is why I'm optimistic and think Goldman Sachs is undervalued:

1) As interest rates rise, banks make more money.  Interest rates are rising.

2) GS is rolling in the cash. Q3 Earnings, $5.3 BILLION.  Even better is the revenue comes from many different areas, all of which seem to be growing. The biggest risk to growth is that investment banking slows down with fewer IPO's possibly in 2022.

3) Solid dividend, huge buybacks of shares.  $2.00 per quarter dividend, and $1 billion in share purchases just in last quarter.  I think buybacks will accelerate now that we are past the worst of covid and the gov isn't holding them back.

4) As boomers retire, they will need someone to manage their money.  Their current assets under management are $2.37 TRILLION!

5) They are helping other company's do Advanced Share Repurchases. Just search on google for stock buyback, and it seems like GS is financing everyone's purchases.  I don't know how much they make from this, but even a few points and it adds up!

6) P/E is 6.5.  Compared to so much else on the market, this is an amazing value play.

Here are the fundamentals: 

43% of the world's uranium supply comes from Kazakhstan, through one arms-length public-private corporation - Kazatomprom (LSE: KAP). Kazakhstan just fired their entire government last night and is in the process of descending into chaos: [Easily Google'd News](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/asia/kazakhstan-fuel-protests-emergency-wednesday-intl/index.html)

KAP is expectedly tanking and every North American uranium play is up ~10% today. 

The inbound supply & demand gap is already making itself apparent in a rapidly increasing uranium spot price: [Twitter uranium spot tracker](https://twitter.com/numerco?t=-vEnG2gH6bSOVNxZjwhIEA&s=09)

Unfortunately, many of the most-likely successful plays in this space are very low market cap mining companies which are too trashy, even for this sub reddit. NYSE:CCJ is your gateway ticket to the uranium space. Feel free to message me to discuss the real hot garbage corporations that may go 10x.

I still see some upside with them but not as much as they’ve experienced this past year. 

On the other hand, VW stock seems to have plenty of room for growth. In the past two year they are only up 8% compared to 85% and 170% from GM and Ford. There P/E is only 5.3 compared to 8.9 (GM) and 34 (Ford). Most of the increase in stock price for GM and Ford has had to do with news surrounding the EVs they are making (I’m using GM and Ford as examples but VW has lagged pretty much all the large car manufacturers). VW is arguably one of the best positioned for EVs. They are investing $100 billion on EVs, their CEO is all bought in, they are looking at manufacturing their own batteries, and their ID4 has done pretty well with over 70,000 purchases.

&#x200B;

Happy New Year everyone!  Let's navigate the chopping waters of wonky market in the most jolly and profitable way.%)

This is my first DD post on WSB!  I more than welcome your feedback and, if you agree with the trade, support too!8)

SKLZ hit all time low yesterday.  If you look at their Finviz data, the company doesn't look too shabby, actually.  During their last earnings they made 102.07M in sales and, for the first time, delivered positive net earnings of 50.78M.  The company is in best shape now than it ever was.  And yet it's at the lowest they've ever been (the high was $46.30).

Yesterday I yoloed about USD 3 grand into weekly options cuz it seems that the upside of sorts is inevitable.  What do you think?

Below is some data supporting my decision.

4. OPEC + maintain production plans unchanged U.S. oil closed 1.2% higher on Tuesday

Caroline Bain, chief commodities analyst at Capital Economics, said that oil prices are supported by the fact that, in contrast to other new crown mutant strains, the current Omicron mutant strain has less severe symptoms and lower mortality rates in those infected, leaving the government without a widespread embargo or travel restrictions that could affect crude oil demand.

On Tuesday, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for February delivery rose 91 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $76.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures price rose nearly 1.2% on Monday.

5. Tuesday's gold futures closed 0.8% higher, recovering half of Monday's losses

Despite the rise in U.S. Treasury yields, gold prices were supported by disappointing U.S. manufacturing economic data for December and uncertainty caused by the mutated strain of Omicron.

Before the central bank's profit surge, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled measures aimed at compensating lira investors for their losses. The Turkish lira fell 44% against the dollar last year, in large part because the Turkish central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 500 basis points since September.

The lira's depreciation has exacerbated consumer price inflation, which ended last year at more than 36%, the highest level since September 2002. Erdogan's popular support has suffered. But even with guaranteed returns on lira deposits, Turkish investors are still holding foreign currency, undercutting Erdogan's efforts to boost the lira without raising interest rates.

9. Poland's central bank raised interest rates to combat inflation, the first national bank to announce a rate hike this year

The dollar opened the first trading day of the new year in the red, while U.S. bond yields soared.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also surged 14.4 basis points (BP) in January 3, rising above 1.64% for the first time since the Omicron outbreak in late November 2021, breaking 1.60%; the U.S. dollar index rose sharply in line with the trend, straight to the 97 mark.

&#x200B;

so for some history, in october 2020 earning did GREAT and it went from around $250 to $300, it stayed there with another good earnings report, then dropped in april 2021 from the supply chain issues. since then it has had some good earning until the last one, where it did pretty bad because of covid.

**LEFT SIDE: ESTIMATED EPS                     RIGHT SIDE: ACTUAL EPS**

[10\/20 is when it spiked.](https://preview.redd.it/iccxp990kr981.jpg?width=1259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd2edc5bea9f0e41fe32d98c539c3270d34d3a09)

so from that i feel like the april 2021 sell off was pretty exaggerated because the next earnings did really well. 

then fall 2021. covid started picking back up, here is thier last earnings info:

so they didnt do terrible in earnings, but apparently income last quarter was terrible. im thinking this jan 6th will be better all around for a few reasons:

1, people adjust to covid over time, it starts with a freak out then settles down.

2, holidays more people have time off to build and fix things.

3, seasonal workers like restaurants slow down, which means more clean up, more precious wd-40 (and 3 in 1 oil which actually is fucking great fyi)

and final reason the estimated eps this time is still low at $1.25. soo if they have an increase in sales they should reach or exceed that, i also read their ceo has a price target of $260 and after the april drop said $250 is too low. its even lower now at $240

they have pretty stable revenue anyway, and are expecting alot of growth.

$MYBUF : The Most Significant Advancement in Science Since They Invented the Sun – Get Cash at a Discount 

Perovskites. Pero what? You heard me. Perovskites. It’s the most significant advancement in science since they invented the Sun. Companies and researchers from around the world, including the Army Research Office and Office of Naval Research are dumping money into perovskites. 

I’m goanna break down for you what Perovskites are. Why they matter. And which companies are poised for huge upside. 

I’m not a chemist. Nor am I an engineer. In fact, I’ve got no formal education of any kind to speak of. So here we go. 

Basically perovskites are family of materials whose structure is made up of calcium titanium oxide. Importantly, their chemical formula is ABX3, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent cations and X is an anion that bonds to both. And that X, well, it can be pretty much anything. Think of it like pasta. All pasta is basically wheat. But add cream sauce and you’ve got a fettuccini alfredo. Add shrimp and garlic, and you’ve got shrimp scamp. Cut the noodles wide and add a ragu, you’ve got lasagna. Different dishes in their own right. But at their core, the same pasta structure. Perovskites are basically the same as pasta. Sturcture is the same, but you can add different ingredients to their chemical compound to get different dishes. 

**Okay. So?** 

Perovskites are wildly efficient at absorbing photons of light and channeling electrical currents. This means perovskites are being deployed throughout semiconductor manufacturing as a ***replacement for silicon*****.** Since basically anyone here can remember, semiconductors have been made with silicon as the primary conductor. Hence ‘silicon valley’. Problem is, silicon is expensive ($$$) requires a bunch of processing hoops (no need to get into what they are since I don’t know em anyway) and to use them in something like solar panels- they’ve gotta big old silicon crystals (big) 

**Enter Perovskites**. 

Researchers and manufactures across the globe are beginning to use perovskites instead of silicon as the conductor in semiconductors. Because 

**Perovskites are:** 1) [Cheaper than silicon.](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/se/c9se00948e) 2) [It can be printer on inkjet printers. ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.0c09485) That’s right. That HP you’ve got lying around could be the future. Just kidding, it probably never worked anyway. 3) 

Not only that. Perovskites are incredibly efficient, and they’re rapidly increasing in efficiency. Especially in solar panels. The conversion efficiency of silicon in solar panels (basically how well it converts solar energy light photons to actual electricity) is 18% - 22%. Perovskites started at 10% photon-to-electricity efficiency in 2012. In 2020, they reached 25.2% ***Perovskites are surpassing silicon as the most effective conductor in solar panels.*** 

&#x200B;

Those orange and yellow dots and that little red triangle with blue in it are perovskite cells being produced. If that was a stock would you buy puts? Didn’t think so. 

**RECAP:** Let’s pause because you probably didn’t read any of that. Perovskites are replacing silicon because they’re cheaper, more easily produced, and more efficient than silicon. And their efficiency is increasing rapidly. 

**Low Production Cost**

Perovskites are expected to decrease rapidly in production cost over time as noted in the chart below. (Source: National Renewable Energy Laboratory)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/65jhoo16br981.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=56cf0e2e8c9e45d946049002d81213ffafebfe57

**So what can they be used for?** 

1) **Everything**.

2) **Solar Panels** We’ve already touched on their efficiency in solar panels, where they’re being used now. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Solar is a massive industry, I’m not going to look it up because I don’t have the time, but it’s pretty big. Any kind of disruption this size is bound to mean C.o.D.

3) **LASERS** As Fan, et al, say in  [*Nanoscale Semiconductor Lasers*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128141625000030)*,* “As a direct bandgap semiconductor, perovskite exhibits the unique optical properties of bandgap tunability, charge-carrier mobility, defect tolerance, [photoluminescence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/photoluminescence) quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiency, which makes them as promising light-emitting materials for high optical gain, low-threshold and multicolor laser applications.” In other words, bigger lasers mean bigger bucks in your pocket. 

4) **X-Rays** When3-D printed perovskite is combined with graphene it provides a detailed x-ray [image 4x more accurate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2590238520306329) than the best x-ray out there right now. 

5) **Self-Repairing Materials** You read that right. A team of researchers in Israel noticed that if you left damaged solar perovskites in the dark, [they returned to function at or near original efficiency](https://www.perovskite-info.com/israeli-researchers-develop-self-healing-perovskite-nanocrystals). Defects in the structure of perovskites are repaired *on their own*. The potential for self-repairing technology is endless. Perovskite solar panels are also flexible and lightweight. 

6) **IoT | Animal Tracking** One perovskite company has i[ntegrated their solar cells onto animal tracking devices](https://sauletech.com/saule-technologies-wwf-iot-bison/), which give the device about 10+ years of battery. This has huge implications for environmental protection efforts and all Internet of Things applications. 

**Financials; For Whom Do I Make Out This YOLO to?** 

There are a few companies d\*\*ks deep in perovskite manufacturing. These include: Oxford PV, Saule Technologies, Swift Solar, and Aixtron. Saule announced in April 2021 they’re going public, but in Poland. Swift Solar is not public, nor is there any news they will be soon. That leaves Aixtron and Oxford PV. Oxford PV isn’t public but it was heavily invested in by Meyer Burger ($MYBUF) – that’s the real ticker. There’s Aixtron ($AIXXF). And then there’s Toshiba ($TOSYY) 

(There's also Chinese manufacturer China New Borun Group ($BORNY) but they’re down -100.00% in the past 6 months) 

Both $MYBUF (what a name) and $AIXXF make perovskites. To be honest, I can’t make heads or tails of what either of these companies do. 

$AIXXF is a world leader in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) for semiconductors. Essentially, that means they spray semiconductors with ultrathin films of perovskite. They recently completed a 3-year study in 2019 funded by a bunch of German universities. 

$MYBUF was heavily invested in Oxford PV. Oxford PV was born in the depth of Oxford University’s science labs where they first saw perovskite’s possibility. $MYBUF had an exclusive partnership with Oxford PV that ended messy in June 2021. I’m not going to go into details, you can guess why, but they went their separate ways. $MYBUF is going through a change- it used to supply manufacturing equipment to the solar industry. But now? They make the solar themselves. And they’re doing it with the perovskite custody they got from Oxford PV. 

$MYBUF [announced plans to open a solar production facility in the US](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/meyer-burger-coming-to-america/)\- up and running by end of this year.  

$MYBUF is on SALE right now at just .46 cents a share. As you can see, $MYBUF had a high of around $340 / share back in ’08 – a price I have every reason to believe it could reach it again.

. 

They’ve also got the strong fundamentals you’d expect to see from an industry visionary.

**$TOSSY**

**WARNING: DO NOT LOOK AT THIS STOCK IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF HEIGHTS** 

We all know Toshiba. Everyone’s first T.V. First Laptop.  Girlfriend, Etc. But did you know Toshiba is a global leader of perovskite semiconductor applications? In Sept. 2021 $TOSYY announced a breakthrough for producing light, flexible, and efficient perovskite. Basically they found a way to print it with ink for a lot cheaper and a lot faster. $TOSYY has its hand in all manner of semiconductor manufacturing. And they’re perfectly poised for a rapid scale up for wide spread global distribution of perovskite semiconductors. 

First- $TOSYY trades at about $20 a pop. It had a record year. A whopping 45.8% return Y/Y. It’s 5 year? 67%. If you look at the chart you can see $TOSYY is poised for another bull run. It reached resistance at around $23 a share back in April.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lfc1jbafbr981.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ccc7a13a31e9109a9f045e85e06ccd58b538e06

Now you might say to yourself- hey, I want to be in on Toshiba’s semiconductor business, but they’re laptops aren’t very good. Well I’ve got good news! Back in April, [Toshiba announced it’s spinning off its semiconductor business into](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2021/11/news-20211112-02.html) DeviceCo as part of a massive restructuring. New shares will be issued for Toshiba shareholders in the second half of 2023. 

That means the pump is PRIMED from $TOSYY as it spins its successful perovskite research and development arm into a business of its own, with $TOSSY still hitting funneling cash its way. 

**If You Need More Proof**

[The Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research has dumped tons of money into perovskite.](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/01/03/army-navy-lend-muscle-to-new-2-d-perovskite-solar-cell-thats-18-more-efficient/) Does the DoD make wrong bets?  

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Perovskites are quickly replacing silicon as the conductor in semiconductors because they’re cheaper, easier to produce, more efficient, and have a wider range of application than silicone. Perovskite work has advanced exponentially in 2021. These companies help put perovskite in semiconductors: $MYBUFF  $AIXXF and  $TOSYY",0.17779525347148298,10459,1460

They have no disruptive technology.  They sell cars.  Car sales over the last couple of years have been  off the charts and they've been making a shit ton of money.  In my mind there is no way that that is going to continue.  There are a number of reasons for this.

The chip shortage is going to be a thing of the past and people will be able to buy new cars again.  That means that the markup on used cars is going to plummet.

Manufacturers aren't going to sit idly by while dealers mark cars up well above the MSRP and make record profits. I've read about the Ford Mach-e being marked up $10,000 and the Mercedes EQS by $50,000.  Already, 12 states have legislation moving forward to allow manufacturers to sell directly to the consumers.  In most cases this only applies to EVs but let's face it, in a few years that's all there's going to be anyway.

Okay so remember when GameStop squeezed and for almost no explicable reason Robinhood halted all buying and selling of the stock? The betrayal could not be more ironic. Robin Hood, a tale we’ve all heard before. The noble warrior does what is right by stealing from the rich and helping the poor who otherwise would be helpless in such a society. The sad truth is that Robinhood not only kept many from placing live changing trades, but they demonstrated to the common man that there is no reason to trust anyone on wallstreet, even those who try so hard to appear trustworthy by having the audacity to name their company something as deceiving as Robinhood.

They tore off the hand that fed them. 

HOOD is %8 down today.

2022-01-04 13:58:39,"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/ky8qh0nzeo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=104b963a012fc82a7a12585615dbd98c402e0a26

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/yc7i0we0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1c59f7bb5c02119e674ffaaf079fa67afa6120

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/5ezb3bw1fo981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb146c04d7e9311751be085f6d21348fafac092

1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.

https://preview.redd.it/rht12ux2fo981.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=c571f5fc7d63fcb095555080320757192129d380

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

https://preview.redd.it/5fszhew3fo981.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cf5e2c992435a6d8ed36dbed707b11dd4cd30ba

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

https://preview.redd.it/1xtamkf0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b9215c2379524644653c67ff375667c8f0354a

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

https://preview.redd.it/11nzh3f0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15a32e373431bc460ce4c082a94ee58e7c392a6

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",0.12059558441558446,11103,1623

**Project Background (gets a bit technical, for geek intended use only):**

A group of friends and I (*MIT and Fortune50 alumni*)  have been working on a context inferential machine. That is a mouthful for sure. What this means though is that we implemented similar techniques currently dominating the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but made them work for the problem of time series forecasting, which is the domain area of stock pricing. 

**What are we using?**

At the core of our project are deep neural networks, more specifically, we are using transformers to identify and contextualise short term trends. By short term we mean that the window of our inferences views the period 5 to 7 days past the inference date. For example if our inference date is January 3rd then our inference window would be January  10th through January 12th.

Besides the ""very high tech"" transformers, we also dealt with typical software engineering issues like having to collect, process and analyse data for over 5000 companies on a daily basis. 

**Are we predicting the future?**

We are not peddling predictions, nobody can predict the future. Even Renaissance Technology is right only about 51% of the time. Our interest is in contextualising the risk involved in buying a stock for swing trading. 

**Why are we doing this?**

We are passionate about artificial intelligence, math and prudent trading. We understand that lots of people will just want to flock into TSLA calls and diamond hand them GME and Yolo their way into riches or ruin. However, we think that there may be a fraction of people who would just want to make more informed decisions and perhaps don't have the time, technical knowhow or desire to deal with vast amounts of data crunching.

As seen by the link above, Meta has just gotten a new price target from Jeffries at  $420 a share, a whole 24% above it's previous close. This is a pretty substantial increase for a large cap and I think that there will be more PTs to follow suit. FBs shift towards the metaverse is a hugely underrated move which will bring in a whole new crowd of social media users. Facebook for a while has been losing its younger users to platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat but this push to the metaverse will bring them back and then some.

Looking at technicals, FB also seems like it's at a buy point. it recently broke out of long term resistance and is now retesting the newly formed support that was that resistance. It has maintained a short term upward channel during this time. Additionally, it has been consolidating for months now after it's whistleblower leak which means it is primed for a move to the upside with all these positive catalysts coming.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7elfNvxC

A break of the 353 area which seems like the next resistance coming would most likely send FB to all time highs. Once again, this all hinges on general markets staying solvent.

4. OPEC + meeting is approaching U.S. oil closed 1.2% higher on Monday

Royal Bank of Canada capital markets analysts led by Helima Croft wrote in a research note published Monday, ""While the number of infections from the mutated strain of Omicron continues to climb in important areas, concerns about crude oil demand may be contained in the near term as no broad embargo restrictions have been adopted.""

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for February delivery rose 87 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $76.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

5. Gold futures closed down 1.6% on Monday, the lowest closing price in two weeks

U.S. stocks and U.S. Treasury yields climbed on the first day of the new year, sending gold futures prices down to their lowest level in two weeks.

""The gold market is battling the negative sentiment that led it to fall 3.6% in 2021,"" Zaner Institutional analysts wrote in a market commentary on Monday.

6. U.S. Treasury yields soared market expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates rose

U.S. Treasury yields soared on the first trading day of 2022, as investor optimism about the economy pushed up U.S. stocks, spurred corporate bond issuance and bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least three times this year.

Benchmark yields climbed across the board, led by the policy-sensitive 5-year Treasury yield, which rose nearly 8 basis points to 1.34%. 2-year Treasury yields topped 0.79%, the highest level since March 2020.

**International Macro**

1. despite the rise in interest rate hike expectations U.S. short-term Treasury bids for the first time this year still received the strongest demand since 2010

On the first trading day of 2022, U.S. Treasury yields spiked across the board as rising economic optimism boosted U.S. equities, attracted a large number of corporate bond issues and boosted expectations for at least three interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.

Based on current interest rate futures prices, the federal funds rate target is expected to rise for the first time in May and is expected to increase by 77 basis points by the end of the year.

Jefferies economist Thomas Simons said the rate hike is expected to be a hot topic.

2. The number of new cases of new crowns in the United States is at a record high, but testing data suggest the actual situation may be much more serious

According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of new cases averaged about 405,000 on a single day over the past week, about 60 percent higher than the U.S. peak back in January 2021. But the number of tests reported by states is still below the 2021 peak.

Meanwhile, the PCR test positivity rate was 17 percent, the highest since April 2020.

The data suggest that many cases of omicron are not being detected as it rages, possibly because people are doing their own rapid testing at home or not doing any testing at all.

3. OPEC+ is likely to increase production again as oil market supply is expected to be tighter than previously forecast

OPEC+ representatives said Tuesday's meeting is expected to approve another modest production increase of 400,000 barrels per day, restarting capacity that was temporarily taken offline during the New Crown outbreak.

At a preliminary meeting on Monday, OPEC analysts lowered their forecast for excess oil market supply in the first quarter as rival supplies are expected to weaken.

OPEC and its allies have so far restored about two-thirds of the capacity they suspended in 2020. They are seeking to restore remaining capacity at a pace that just meets the recovery in oil demand, avoiding a price spike or sending the market into a new slump. So far they have had the desired effect, with international crude prices nearing $78 a barrel.

According to a report available, the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee is now forecasting a surplus supply of 1.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2022, about 25 percent less than it predicted a month ago.

The committee believes that the impact of the omicron variant is expected to be ""mild and short-lived"" as ""the world becomes better equipped to deal with the new crown epidemic and the challenges it presents.

4. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration: the development of a new crown vaccine specifically for omicron strain is not necessary

Peter Marks, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which evaluates new crown pneumonia vaccines, said on Jan. 3 local time that the development of a new crown vaccine specifically for the Omicron strain may not be necessary.

Marks said that although all vaccine development companies are working to develop an effective vaccine against the Omicron strain, it is not yet known whether the Omicron strain will remain the main prevalent strain in the New Crown pneumonia outbreak as time goes on.

5. Erdogan's first ""report card"" of the new monetary policy: CPI soared 36% year-on-year to a new high of nearly two decades

On Monday, local time, Turkey's official statistics institute released the country's December CPI data. Stimulated by the new monetary policy, the country's price index saw a rare 13.58 percent year-over-year increase, pulling the annualized inflation rate to a staggering 36.08 percent.

Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner of Istanbul-based Spinn Consulting, said in a media interview that in the face of such an emergency, the benchmark interest rate should be raised sharply and quickly, but the Turkish central bank is unlikely to take action at the moment.

So when the impact of official policies on prices (such as a 50% increase in the minimum wage, etc.) takes hold, the annualized increase in inflation could touch 40%-50% in March this year.

6. Turkey ordered exporters to convert 25% of their income into lira

Turkey's central bank said in a decree on Monday that once exporters receive payments in dollars, euros or pounds, the central bank will buy 25 percent of them.

7. Italy's public administration minister: the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index grew for 18 consecutive months

Local time on January 3, the Italian Minister of Public Administration Brunetta revealed that the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index in December 2021 was 62, has been stable in the rising range for 18 consecutive months, and Italy's GDP is expected to grow by 6.3% in 2021.

8. The United States and Europe Omicron cases ""vertical growth"", many countries refused to tighten the epidemic prevention, foreign media: ""the world is flooded by Omicron""

In the past week, the United States highest single-day new confirmed cases of nearly 700,000 cases, again shaking the world.

In the world's latest ranking of confirmed cases or deaths of new coronary pneumonia, most of those at the top are American and European countries, which is also known as the world's most alarming ranking. In the face of a continuously worsening epidemic, many Western countries are unexpectedly relaxing quarantine regulations

**Company News**

1. Apple closed up more than 2% on Monday to hit a record high, with market capitalization surpassing the $3 trillion mark for the first time during the session

Shares of Apple Inc. closed up 2.5 percent at $182.01 on Monday, a record high, with a market capitalization of $2.98 trillion. The company's total market capitalization surpassed the $3 trillion mark for the first time, becoming the first company ever to reach the milestone.

3. Guggenheim: Bullish on Nike's entry into meta-universe listed as top stock pick for 2022

Guggenheim named Nike as a ""top stock"" for 2022 on Monday.

He said Nike should be able to meet the financial targets set last June, despite the recent impact of global supply chain disruptions.

4. ""Dalio's successor"" and a change of crop, Bridgewater Fund announced the CEO position change

The latest personnel changes, also in charge of $ 150 billion in assets of Bridgewater once again face the issue of succession under scrutiny.

Since Dalio, who turned 72 this year, quit the fund's day-to-day management in 2011 to focus on investment research, five people have come and gone in the position until McCormick became the solo CEO in 2019.

For Bridgewater's new management, the biggest difficulty is still how to improve the company's investment performance and retain clients.

2022-01-04 06:36:27,"$ZIP: set up for a massive run in 2022Zip Recruiter ($ZIP) is a mispriced stock. I'm not  a professional stock analyst and not giving investment advice, but the data below has me wondering why ZIP is currently trading for $25. Look at these charts and make your own conclusion. The stock is fundamentally underpriced, and it's going to moon after the next earnings call.

1. **ZIP is an extremely high growth company, but the stock is getting no love**

* The reason zip recruiter is growing so much is driven by the “great resignation”, and employees leaving their jobs to go find better jobs. This is a trend that isn’t going to go away in 2022
* If ZIP hits their Q4 guidance, their YOY growth rate will be 75%. I think Q4 guidance is way too low (see point #2), and my guess is that the company will be over 80% growth for 2021
* In the world of software, there are only a few publicly traded companies growing revenues faster than 70% year over year… in my analysis, I only found 3 comparable companies (SNOW, BILL, S)
* The three companies below having insane growth are all much bigger, and have significantly  higher valuations. Enterprise value multiples are all at least 10-30x greater than ZIP
* The average software company under $10B market cap is growing at 18%, but has a 10x enterprise value/revenue multiple
* If ZIP had the same EV/Rev multiple of it’s slower growing peers, it would be a $70-$100 stock
* Why does ZIP get no love? Tough to say. They just went public this year via direct listing, their market cap is a rounding error compared to other software companies, not many analysts follow them… regardless, they won’t stay under the radar for too much longer  

https://preview.redd.it/5ilohiss5m981.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=91bd47b3b122cb21ba2bab37590dd964622f34e3

**2. ZIP is always cautious on revenue guidance, but then they deliver huge beats. Q4 will be no different (earnings release will be early Feb)** 

* The chart below shows quarterly revenue by quarter… Q2 2020 was the bottom of the pandemic, but you can see that revenues have steadily grown each quarter
* The orange bars are the company’s guidance… ZIP always set the bar extremely low, and then crushes with actual results
* The company guided Q4 revenue for $209M, which is actually less than Q3 revenues of $213M… a simple trend line would estimate Q4 revenues between $230-$240M
* When ZIP beat posted revenue of $213M in Q3 against guidance of $188M, the stock jumped 13% that trading day
* ZIP will report early February, and with their current price around $25, the stock will blow up (assuming that it stays steady in January) 

https://preview.redd.it/sap6h3na6m981.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=84277936e0a34beba9b6b0c64c5b05bbfa48a592

**3.  But what about profitability? In this time period of rising inflation, don’t investors want to see positive margins?**

* ZIP is profitable on a GAAP basis... In Q3 ZIP posted net income of $22M on revenues of $213M, for healthy margins of 10.3%
* Snowflake, bill.com and SentinelOne are all nowhere near profitability
* ZIP is a rare company delivering growth >70% AND profitability 

**4. The macro economic environment is setting ZIP up to do very well in 2022**… people are leaving their jobs at a record number, and companies are struggling to hire. High inflation times will force companies to pay more for good talent... thus, ZIP can actually pass the inflation on to their customers (companies looking to hire) and they could be relatively unaffected by inflation 

**5. TL/DR… buying ZIP for $25 a share is a steal; after next earnings call and once the company gets more attention, the stock could easily double or triple in 2022**

**6. Positions or ban:** Yes... I heavily believe this thesis and have been buying shares all of 2021. I’m long 2500 shares and also long call options at $25 expiring in Jan

Step 2: Buy calls on the tickers mentioned in the posts with the most upvotes, because upvotes = heaviest losses = celebrated here as martyrs. Also because these tickers show up in the lossporn section, it is likely they are oversold and by using the Law of Equal Retardation, they are most likely to bounce back soon after heavy losses have been incurred.

Somehow you survive and want to make a shit ton of money.  So everyone tells your theaters look dingy AF, floors are super sticky and your descriptive audio headphones look like they are from the 80s. 

Well lucky for you [Grand Pappa Silber figured it out](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/education/edlife/how-to-raise-a-universitys-profile-pricing-and-packaging.html)  . TL;DR: you want your shit to look good? Make it so expensive AF.   

Which of these sounds like a nicer theater:
Theater A: $10 / ticket. $6 / popcorn

OR

Theater B: $100 / ticket, $25 / popcorn

OR

Theater C: $10,000 / year long subscription, $56 / use popcorn fee, not optional, $400 cleaning fee (not optional)  


We all know that C is GOING to be the best.

If you're looking at A and saying ""This is the one"" good for you! on finishing that community college degree!

If you're looking at B then congrats on your college's football record!




You might be saying ""well wait, why would anyone pay $10k a year to see the same shit you can see for $4 at the mom and pop theater?""  Well to you I ask: Why would people pay $70k / year to ""attend"" classes online when the content is the exact same shit you can get on YouTube for free?

2022-01-04 01:20:28,"DD - What are Dark Pools and how do they work?Tonight, I found myself watching level 2 data for a certain ticker and noticed a LARGE portion of the time&sales orders were designated as TRF (Trade Reporting Facility), and the remaining portion was designated as NAS (NASDAQ).  When orders went through, TRF trades did NOT affect the order book.

So naturally, my question was ""WTF is TRF???""

Well, it appears that TRF is where entities report off-exchange trades to the NYSE.  If you want to do your own DD, here is a link to the reporting format for TRF orders
[NYSE_TRF_Messaging_Spec](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse/NYSE_TRF_Messaging_Spec.pdf)

Upon looking into the spec, I was flagged by all the recent changes were implemented by a ""Bryan Tobin""

Bryan Tobin is a manager at NYSE Chicago and has been submitting all the changes since 2015.
Here is the 
[NYSE Chicago Location](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/Citadel+Enterprises+America's+LLC,+South+Dearborn+Street,+Chicago,+IL/@41.8800351,-87.637736,16z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x880e2cbcb2674a9d:0x424899df3c9d2a63!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e2cbf4c6c02cd:0xf04e48e640a6f2a8!2m2!1d-87.6375316!2d41.8803115!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e2cbca3176469:0xb50c07f9bb38b9c1!2m2!1d-87.6291641!2d41.8797542)

If you look through the change revisions, there was one in particular that stood out to me... change 4.5 ""TradeModifier2 = 7 Qualified
Contingent Trade; changed from
FINRA contingent trade""

So, what is a qualified contingent trade (QCT) and why does it matter?
Prior to 2008, QCTs required trades to be minimum 10,000 shares or $200,000 in value.
[Order 34-57620](https://www.sec.gov/rules/exorders/2008/34-57620.pdf) removed that limitation, now not having any size requirements since according to the order, ""CBOE believes that removing the Size Condition will not result in a
large increase in the number of transactions being exempted from Rule 611 because smaller
contingent trades represent a very small portion of the overall amount of stock executions in
listed stocks.""

These trades are now designated as EXEMPT from [Securities Exchange Act Rule 611](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/notice_doc_file_ref/Regulatory-Notice-18-29.pdf)

That seems pretty funny, doesn't it?

It appears that now, off-exchange transactions can be simply marked as QCT Exempt through TRF messaging spec, section 22002.  As long as the broker and the market maker agree on a price, they trade through exemption at that price.

I understand that I did not ELI5 this whole thing, but it is really worth looking into the documentation yourself to comprehend exactly what the market makers and brokerages are doing with retail trades.

I would love to hear from others who are more knowledgeable than I am on this matter and if it has any weight to it.

TLDR: Ultimately, the two iconic New York teams are valued at $7.1 billion without their stadium.

————-

For the first time ever, a National Hockey League team is valued at $2 billion in the annual valuation rankings from Forbes. Here’s what the valuation estimate and recent acquisition activity in the space could mean for the owner of the Rangers, which is publicly traded.

What Happened: The average National Hockey League team saw a 32% rise in its value assigned in the annual Forbes rankings. The average NHL team is worth $865 million in the new rankings.

This marked the biggest one-year average gain to the average NHL valuation by Forbes since a 50% gain in 2012 when a new Canadian market television deal was signed.

Leading the NHL team rankings is the New York Rangers, valued at $2 billion. The valuation of the Rangers was up 21% from the previous year and marked the first time a team was valued at $2 billion.

Credited with the increase in valuation changes were several recent team sales and a rise in league revenue.

The Pittsburgh Penguins recently entered a deal with Fenway Sports Group for a $900 million purchase price, or around 4.5 times expected revenue for the current 2021-'22 season. Prior to the deal, the average multiple was around four times revenue, according to Forbes.

Deals for the Carolina Hurricanes (2018), New York Islanders (2016), and Arizona Coyotes (2014, 2019) were done at multiples of 3.9, 4.2, 3.3 and 3.0, respectively.

League revenue is increasing thanks to media deals. ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Turner, owned by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) signed new deals that started this season paying the NHL an average of $625 million a year. The previous U.S. media deals from ESPN and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) unit NBC paid an average of $300 million annually.

The league reported hockey-related revenue of $2.9 billion in the 2020-'21 season. Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion in 2021-'22 and increase to $6 billion for the 2025-'26 season.

Madison Square Garden Sports: The Rangers are owned by Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (NYSE:MSGS), a publicly-traded sports holding company. Madison Square Garden Sports owns the Rangers, the New York Knicks (NBA), Westchester Knicks (NBA G League), Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL) and esports assets such as Counter Logic Gaming and Knicks Gaming, which is in the 2K League owned by the NBA and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO).

The latest rankings from Forbes break the Rangers down at $468 million for sport, $893 million for the market, $309 million for the stadium and $330 million for the brand. The team’s iconic Madison Square Garden Arena is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp (NYSE:MSGE).

The Knicks were valued at $5.8 billion in the latest Forbes rankings, up 16% from the previous year. The valuation is broken down as $2.0 billion for sport, $2.5 billion for market, $403 million for the stadium and $918 million for the brand.

Taking out the value of Madison Square Garden Arena and the Rangers are valued at $1.7 billion. The Knicks would be valued at $5.4 billion without the stadium. There could be some additional overlap between the values of the teams being owned together.

Ultimately, the two iconic New York teams are valued at $7.1 billion without their stadium.

2022-01-03 17:49:51,"Healthcare/Biotech Sector DD (what to look for and how to value companies)As we are currently in the midst of the global pandemic, where there have been almost 250 million cases and over 5 million deaths, the world is now acutely aware of the dangers of disease. This paranoia has directed a lot of attention towards the Healthcare sector in business, which has consistently been one of the fastest growing sectors in the past few decades. Another huge metric that will boost growth in the healthcare sector is the rise in an aging population around the world as a result of the aging “baby boomer generation”, which is an extremely large demographic containing more than 71 million people. This aging demographic will lead to more sales and investments in the healthcare sector as companies work to provide treatment for treating disabilities and illnesses that develop with age such as Alzhemiers and Arthritis. 

There are many reasons for this such as the rise of technological advances in medicine, obesity epidemics, and global reach of disease. Some of the noteworthy aspects of the healthcare sector which is seen by investors to have high potential growth are in Biotechnology and Vaccination. The Coronavirus epidemic made a point to highlight the importance of vaccinations in helping to prevent the spread and lighten the severity of global pandemics. As a result of the Coronavirus potentially being a yearly recurrence, this is a potentially a huge market for many Vaccine related companies. Some of the leading companies in developing vaccinations such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson have seen massive growth from developing and sales of vaccines. 

Additionally, another reason that the Healthcare sector is attractive to investors is because of the rise in advancement of biotechnology. New techniques for gene editing such as CRISPR-Cas9 has already been introduced into some medical procedures and have shown solid performance. Despite having a few setbacks, it is a very solid belief that once these are overcome, it will become a revolutionary new tool for treatmenting and potentially curing genetic disease. Additionary, many other potentially world changing biotechnology products have been provided massive funding and are undergoing extensive development such as Single cell technologies, Aptamer diseases, stem cell therapies, and DNA hard drives. If even a single one of these products are successfully developed to aid in large scale medical procedures, the company will encounter explosive growth. 

Unfortunately, another factor that is also contributing to increased growth in the Healthcare sector is the overall worsening of the environment. The decrease in air quality in many of the major cities around the world as well as major pollution seen in water and earth contributes to a decrease in overall health around the world. This is a major problem that is affecting the whole world, and can be seen in studies which show that air pollution is a factor that leads to almost 7 million deaths per year, these are due to health effects which contribute to diseases such as strokes, lung cancer, and heart disease of which ⅓ of the deaths are attributed to air pollution.

**Biotechnology:** Biotechnology company valuation metrics are different from the typically “standard” for valuing companies. Metrics such as Cash Flow and EBITDA do not tell the full story as many biotech companies do not make much money until they get FDA approval for a drug. 

My approach for valuing biotech companies is by relying on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), which by adding the present value of each drug handled by the company to the net present value will give a fair value for  what the whole company is worth.

**Pharmaceuticals:** For pharmaceutical companies standard valuation metrics such as Cash Flow Statements and EBITDA are heavily considered. Additionally we should put a heavy emphasis on the companies R&D spending as well and development cost per product. 

**Danger Signs:**

We should also be aware of a few risk factors when looking into companies in the healthcare sector. Customer trust is extremely important for this sector as the effects of these products directly affect the lives of its customers. 

As such we must keep in mind the customer complaints regarding the company's products as well as any controversies the company has been involved in in the past.

**EDIT; Ah the huge pop today was because DISC was** [fully cleared by the European Commission for the merger to proceed](https://www.barrons.com/articles/discovery-disca-stock-warnermedia-merger-europe-51641237897) **- Woohoo, things are finally in motion!**

**TLDR;** This stock has been battered out of the Archegos scandal and concerns over debt in the upcoming merger, but is surprisingly overlooked as a potential value play in a market that is starved for value, and long overdue for a reasonable return after nearly a year of capitulation. Stock may be flat until merger, but it would be wise to start building a position now as the capitulation may have reached a floor (see 7-10% gain in first day of trading for 2022).

**Disclosure;** I am long DISCA and long DISCK.

**Target;** DISC trades at a significant discount in forward EV/EBITDA (x8.45) compared to competitors NFLX (x32.7) and DISNEY (x22). ARPU stands to grow from $7 - $11 at merger, an increase of 57%. Conservatively, were EV/EBITDA to grow linearly in accordance to x13.27, it would still trade at a discount to its peers and a share price of \~$36 (56% upside)

**Tip;** Prefer DISCK over DISCA (voting) shares as DISCK still trades at a discount and all shares will be rolled into the same class of newco.

The DISC merger, expected in Q2 2022 - where T spins off its Warner Media division (including HBO) to form NewCo is one of the biggest upcoming deals this year.

Looking at the IP portfolio for newco is staggering - 200000 hours of content spanning WB, HBO (Dune, Matrix, Succession, Westworld, GoT...), TLC, HGTV (basically all the reality tv), DISC, TNT, CNN, Olympics and more. It spans a massive content sector (specific to un/scripted reality-tv, sports, major film releases for the remaining cable-cutting audience that consumes this particular content) for the streaming industry that is lacking in the current streaming ecosystem (eg, most of this material was pulled from Hulu). DISC carries massive international potential through its reach across 220+ countries and 50 languages (eg, [DISC holds exclusive rights for Olympics broadcasting in Europe until 2024 - with the next Olympics around the corner - valued at 1.4B](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-awards-all-tv-and-multiplatform-broadcast-rights-in-europe-to-discovery-and-eurosport-for-2018-2024-olympic-games)). Another key issue was the simple inability for non US markets to access/subscribe to HBO until the launch of HBO max for Latin America and Europe in late 2021. There's no question the content library is there, but what about the numbers?

With an TTM PE of 17 (vs. NFLX 53, DISNEY 142) and only 20M subscribers vs. NFLX 240M and DISNEY 118M - and an estimated newco growth to \~100M via the merger this year (76M via HBO Max, 22M from DISC) the potential for growth is quite apparent. The combined Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stands to be $11/user (or 1.10B/month - 13.2B/year with a free cash flow of 7.83B/year. With DISC ARPU currently at approximately $7, this is a 57% gain in ARPU immediately at merger. With a conservative estimate of a mere 5% user growth per year, we reach approximately 130M subscribers by 2026. (AT&T guidance alone [expects 150M for HBO max alone for 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/att-expects-120-million-to-150-million-hbo-max-subs-by-end-of-2025.html)).  Management forecasts cost-savings through the merger (reducing marketing spend of independent entities into one), but say ARPU remains consistent in the worst case scenario, that increases revenue to 1.43B for 2026 of 17.16B/year. The two companies currently produce an average FCF at around 59%, which again, in the worst case scenario (remaining flat) brings us to a conservative estimate for FCF of 10.3B/year. Future CEO, David Zaslav [points to a long term goal of 400M subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/david-zaslav-on-subscriber-goals-for-combined-discovery-warnermedia.html) which would bring this estimate even higher.

Management has expressed expectations to reduce gross debt down from 5.0x gross debt/EBITDA within a few years. Given the conservative FCF growth estimate of 33%, this seems reasonable.

T holders receive 71% in newco, DISC holders receive remaining 29%. This presents a potential 112.45B EV and 60B of debt for a total market cap of 52.45B for newco, and an estimated 2.4m shares outstanding at the current price \~ $22.90.

\--

Finally, for those of you that like a short squeeze, DISCA currently holds a FF% of 13.5% and Days to Cover of 10.14 (compare to AMC 20%, 2.35, GME 16.46% 4.37, SNDL 18.6% 3.38) according to the latest data from Ortex.

2022-01-03 11:56:39,"Why $OSTK is undervalued and I’m tempted to go all in🚀Company background:

Overstock.com was founded in 1997 and is primarily an online retailer for home goods, but they also own a subsidiary called Medici Ventures, a venture capital fund that manages and oversees 19 block ⛓ technology companies. 

Current Stock Price and Market Cap:

$58 and $2.5 Billion

Bull Cases:

- Trading at less than 0.9x price to sales compared to the industry average of 4.5x

- $512 million in cash (20% of market cap)

- Announced $100 million stock repurchase program

- Positive free cash flow

- 6 straight profitable quarters

- 23% gross margins 

- Ranked 4th in online revenue out of online home furnishing brands, (a $325 billion market.) Only behind Amazon, Wayfair, and Walmart

- Have been able to avoid supply chain issues while also increasing their margins with their distributed supply chain network and drop shipping business model. 

- Taking market share from Wayfair despite Wayfair trading at a 40% P/S premium over OSTK. Not to mention Wayfair isn’t even profitable 

- Projected 12% growth in 2022 despite the pandemic fueled hyper growth they experienced throughout 2020-2021.

- The value of their ownership of Medici Ventures is not baked it to the stock price. tZero and Bitt (the two largest holdings) are worth at least $1 billion by themselves, not to mention the other 17 companies they hold.

- tZero is reportedly looking to get bought out or could possibly go public via SPAC. Either of these would send Overstock to the 🌕

- Average analyst price target is $120 with a street high of $157 and low of $90. (Current price is $59)

Bear Cases:

- Q3 revenue growth slightly decelerated by -4% since Q3 of 2020 

- Competitors with behemoths such as Amazon and Walmart

- Stock has been getting crushed recently for no fundamental reason, going from $108 on 11/19 to $59 on 12/31. Though I believe this is likely the bottom as the stock has gone from $60 to $100+ 3 times in the last year

- Shorts love this stock. 12% of free float sold short

Summary:

I know Overstock isn’t the most exciting company out there but the the value and risk/reward here is undeniable. Their online retail business alone is definitely undervalued and their ownership of Medici Ventures basically serves as a free call option within the stock. They also have juicy premiums which is nice for hodlers who like to sell covered calls",0.1351125541125541,2424,416

2022-01-03 02:36:47,"QE is not money printingObviously the narrative of 2020 and 2021 has been don't fight the fed because the fed has control of the printing press and will keep printing until the dollar goes to zero. Also that all that printed money has to find a home which basically flows into the stock market. I initially believed this narrative until I saw what bond yields were trading at and realized countries like Japan and much of Europe were doing QE for decades without hyperinflation. Here's a quick example of how QE works: bank buys 10 trillion of bonds from the treasury. They now have 10 trillion of bonds as assets on their books. The fed then buys those from the bank and the bank now has 10 trillion of reserves on it's balance sheet instead. Nothing really has changed since this is basically an asset swap and the bank could have sold those treauries on the open market if it needed cash as they tend to be quite liquid. Meanwhile the fed's balance sheet has increased by 10 trillion. 

Fast forward to late 2021 and the big banks are parking close to 2 trillion dollars at the federal reserve on a daily basis to earn interest on excess reserve. Basically what happened is the fed gave banks reserves and the banks in turn just parked those reserves at the fed instead of making new loans. This goes against the mainstream narrative that money from QE has to flow into stocks. My conclusion is that the stock market effect from QE would appear almost completely psychological unless someone has a different opinion and could educate me.",0.06414141414141414,1540,275

2022-01-03 00:33:14,"$PL Planet Labs PBC trading at a triple bottomOn my phone so fuck you this is gonna be short.

Planet Labs $PL is an Earth Observation (EO) 🌍 space tech company pivoting to Software as a Service (SaaS) with a $600mn cash injection from their recent IPO to give them a 5 year ramp to turn from loss to profit whilst they continue to leverage and sell their existing 75PB data catalogue to create value added products using machine learning to provide curated information to agriculture, sustainability, defense, construction, investigative journalism, media, and FinTech.

They have already done the bulk of the necessary CapEx, since 2015 they have put up \~200 SuperDove cube satellites (micro sats) that scan the entire Earth surface every day creating a 3.5m resolution map of the entire globe in RGB+near infrared (for vegetation monitoring). They also have 21 taskable 0.5m resolution SkySats that offer a better temporal revisit and thus more flexibility than their competitors, even if those competitors offer slightly better imagery (Maxar/Airbus).

They hit their mission to scan the entire Earth surface in 2017 and have only gone on to expand since.

They are launching another 44 new and improved SuperDoves on a SpaceEx Falcon 9 transporter 3 mission this year so 🚀. I'm expecting this event may be a catalyst for price movement.

They're an SPAC and a small cap so the market hates them, on launch they plummeted from a $2.8bn valuation to $1.6bn after lowering Q4 guidance (yeah, not a particularly cool move).

That $2.8bn reflects their 2019 VC value of $2.2bn + $0.6bn in cash. Except they have nearly 50% more customers, over 1/3 more satellites and 30% higher revenues than 2019.

Currently they are trading at half that and ramping the business, with an additional 28 sales positions under the guidance of the Salesforce CEO.

Insiders have bought across the $6-7 range, and everything suggests this stock has a floor around $5.90. Google also topped up their ownership from 10% to 13.2% at this level, would expect they probably know whats up. Google also happen to be the largest player in the EO processing space, currently commercialising their Earth Engine suite to multinationals (Proctor&Gamble, Unilever, etc) for supply chain monitoring. Sustainability is a buzz word rn.

Currently they are the only company with this kind of data set and they are in a unique position to leverage it to produce novel information for a diverse TAM they place at $100bn.

Also their oblique (sideways ish) view imagery from their SkySats (used for 3D Earth) is fucking hot.

* How old are you?
* When will you need the money?
* Will you consider Hedge Funds?
* Will you consider REITs?
* Will you consider Commodities?
* Will you consider International Investing?
* What is the value of your investment portfolio?
* How much do you save a year?
* What percent of your savings is in tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s, or 403(b)s?
* How many people, such as a child, spouse, or aging parent, are financially dependent on you?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 3 years?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 10 years?
* How much equity do you have in your home, or do you rent?
* What is your marginal federal tax rate?
* How much volatility can you live with?
* What is the reading over the U.S. economy over the next 12 months?

Assuming that one has a young 22-year old, fresh out of college who rents, and has no investible assets. Retirement is a long time away. I came up with this as an example:

* Cash 1%
* Cash Equivalents 7.3%
* Bonds 2.8%

In the book Ellis talks about a rule Jefferson had for dealing with the British and his mistrust of them toward the former colonies during this time. I believe he could have used this to describe most of WSB. 

Excerpt from the book, in the chapter discussing Jeffersons’s time in Paris between 1784-89:

“Jefferson claimed he had an infallible rule for deciding what that nation, England, would do on every occasion. It was a simple rule namely, “To consider what they ought to do and to take the reverse of that as what they would assuredly do”. He claimed that by adopting this formula he was never deceived.”

# 4 New de-SPACs for 2021 ($ARVL)

There’s no investment advice here. If that’s what you’re looking for, then off you fuck.

Spotted an error? Good for you. Don’t like something? Unless it’s celery that you don’t like then I don’t care. If it is celery you don’t like then you can be my friend.

**There’s a fuck ton of personal opinion in this. Deal with it.**

This ain’t no due diligence. If you want to be duly diligent about something then make it about the route you take walking away from here.

Anyway, that’s the niceties over and done with, so here we go……

Arrival ($ARVL)

4 new products promised: a 4.25 ton delivery van (Q3 ‘22), a “large” van, a bus (Q2 ‘22) and a car primarily designed for ride hailing (Q3 ‘23).

Number of employees: >2,400 at Q3 report date

HQ: UK, London

Mkt Cap: \~$5bn (NASDAQ)

Battery Supplier: Cells from LG Chem, battery packs assembled in-house.

Planned Production Sites: US x2, UK x1, Spain x1

Pre-orders: **>64,000 units** including **10,000 vans** to UPS (total also may include options for an additional 10,000 units), \~**7,700 buses** and **3,000 vans** to Lease Plan. All done through MOUs, LOIs etc. All orders appear to be cancellable / non-binding.

Major investors pre-SPAC: Black Rock (€98.8m), Hyundai Kia (€98.3m), UPS (€9.8m), WCPF II (€49.2m).

Short Positions: \~10% with \~5.5 days cover

**Summary**

$ARVL is attempting to gain value by a unique, highly automated, micro factory production model with a capacity of 10,000 units per microfactory. Although there is scant evidence that it’s close to being ready (and a lot more evidence that it’s behind schedule and over cost), if the low-cost and low capex production system works then it will set $ARVL up with a potentially highly profitable business. It wouldn't be outside the realms of reality for it to take a lot more time for the production system to work effectively, however, the Bus may well be easily assembled by hand, giving a source of revenue. The Van products would likely be more heavily affected by a lack of automation (a bus is large, but will have proportionately less parts on it for its size compared to a van, and therefore you can have more people working on assembling it)

They’ve gone for a lot of vertical integration in their parts without stating which parts they are designing, which although gives greater flexibility on design and better control over costs, it also forces all liability onto them as well. With no history of vehicles on the road, this could be seen as a cost risk once vehicles are in-market. Unique technology includes an impressive, in house, carbon composite used for exterior panels.

Vehicles are designed to not need stamping, welding and paint facilities which reduces CAPEX requirements for production facilities. Without stamping it will remove a normally very high cost burden in vehicle design as well.

Even with 2,400 employees, 4 vehicles is a lot to be working on simultaneously, and while trying to establish 4 micro factories and designing homegrown components, any delays in generating revenue are likely to strain cash reserves, despite what was generated through the SPAC process and subsequent bonds and follow-on share offerings.

The Q4 report is going to be critical. Revenue targets for 2023 given during the SPAC process were withdrawn in the Q3 report. If it doesn’t have A LOT of good news and revenue targets for 2023 then the share price is likely to take a hit, especially since ***they aim to be at full production capacity in Q1 2023*** \- in 12 months time.

Next $ARVL Report: Q4 results, approx Mid Feb 2022

Must Have:

* Positive news about a working microfactory, with a definitive **date for finishing commissioning** and **preferably** the **percentage of build automation that they are able to achieve**
* Confirmation of a start date for the First Group bus trial.
* Reintroduction of sales volume and revenue estimates for 2023

Hope for:

* An update on progress of the Bus proving ground trials, with numbers to support the information
* No further microfactory announcements without confirmation that the first two are operational and effective.

Vehicles - Market and Engineering viewpoint and opinion. Take it or leave as you will. I don’t give a shit either way!

**Bus:**

$ARVL have stated that of approx 64k pre-orders as of Q3 report date, 12% of these are buses. With a price target to be “competitive with diesel” equivalents, and a diesel bus in Europe costing in the range of €200,000, that gives a loose revenue projection in the range of €1.5bn for this product, though it’ll likely take a while to produce over 7k buses.

The pricing of the bus is worth noting: if $ARVL can truly make an EV bus for €200k and make money on it, and other European EV bus manufacturers are selling at double that price, then $ARVL not only has scope to significantly increase their price to generate more profit and revenue, they can do it while still undercutting their competitors. Cities across Europe and other geographic areas are driving the requirement for zero emissions buses, so demand will be there with an expectation that they’re expensive.

On December 28th, the company announced that proving ground trials had begun, hence meeting their objective to start trials in Q4…..just. The timing, 3 days before the end of the quarter, seems a bit too convenient to be fully truthful!

On-road trials are scheduled to begin in the UK with First Group in Q1 2022, giving them until the end March to start.

If the proving ground trials which involve “rigorous validation and testing ahead of certification” (which doesn’t mean anything in engineering terms - it’s likely to be an accelerated durability test as per the Van announcement, along with whatever certification tests they want to do before the official tests) started late December it’ll several months to complete - approximately 2 to 6 months depending on exactly what they’re doing - assuming there aren’t any major issues. However, major issues for a new product from a new company are absolutely to be expected. By the time these issues have been investigated, part revisions designed, engineered and produced, then retrofitted onto vehicles, it will add a significant chunk of time onto the schedule to start the First Group trial. The only other alternative is to start the trial on schedule but proceed with known risk(s) of failure which could ultimately hurt their chances of picking up sales from First Group.

They also have plans on the US bus market as well. Comments made during a meeting to discuss the SPAC with CIIG included “An electric bus in the US generally sells at around $750 thousand dollars. A diesel bus generally sells for $450 thousand dollars. We expect to produce an electric-powered “better” bus for less than $450 thousand dollars with an attractive operating margin”. They announced an order for 5 buses from Anaheim, CA in July 2021.

**Conclusion:** Massive potential revenue and profit, but it’ll likely be slow to get into market in any volume.

**Car:**

In May 2021 they announced a “collaboration” with Uber to produce a ride-hailing focussed vehicle for the UK and EU markets. There is no indication of any money exchanging hands or orders being placed for this, rather that they are “exploring strategic partnerships” so it would appear to be more of a marketing arrangement for the time being, rather than anything else. That may change.

Uber has stated that they are targeting all city based vehicles to be zero-emission by 2025 as part of their Clean Air Plan, and have been growing a fund to assist drivers with the cost of changing their vehicles. Uber already has EVs from most of the major manufacturers on their allowed-vehicles list. Given the current waiting times for the most popular EVs (anecdotally upto a year for the VW ID4), a late 2023 SOP date may not be harmful to $ARVL.

The success of the $ARVL car will come down to costs. Any standard passenger car sale is sensitive to total cost of ownership (excl ultra premium and sports cars). That includes not just day-to-day running costs, but also residual value. But herein lies the problem - a new vehicle from an unknown manufacturer is likely to have a very low residual value as there’s little demand in the second hand market for an unknown brand car, which in turn pushes up lease costs. If the vehicle is further being used to generate income (i.e. from ridehail drivers) then it’s unlikely to be purchased / leased unless it’s at a compelling price. Their solution to this may be to offer a guaranteed minimum buy-back price after any lease finishes. That would control the residual price but at the same time give them a significant cost burden if they can’t then subsequently re-lease the vehicles as “used” or sell them for a sensible price in the open market.

They “revealed” an Alpha prototype of the Car in a video on December 16th 2021 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5vS2ZNgfA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5vS2ZNgfA)).

It’s difficult to tell from the information available how “premium” the car is, but as a rough guideline, there’s the sliding scale relationship between sales volume and price / profitability - as with most stuff - you either produce very high volume at low margin per vehicle (Fiat 500), or you slide up the scale towards very low volume / very high margin (Mercedes S Class). So the question is, where on the scale is the $ARVL car? Since there’s no data on range, battery options, mass, drive train, equipment, performance and only an implication on overall size (“the footprint of a VW Golf”), and no real interior shots, it’s not really possible to draw any firm conclusions. From what’s in the video, it looks like they’ve followed the Tesla approach of ultra-minimalist (read: cheap), though that doesn’t infer anything about cost. In any case, they’ll probably need to offer the vehicle at a hefty discount vs the price of whatever vehicle(s) they’ve defined as the competitor(s).

It’s probably also worth saying that they have made a point of the amount of space in the rear - in this engineer’s opinion, while it’s not a bad thing, it’s not a good sales point either. There are plenty of passenger cars in the market which have a lot of rear space but few of them are currently in use throughout most of Europe as passenger car based Ubers. There are however quite a few examples of failed vehicles which were marketed as having a lot of rear space……

The boot (trunk) also looks quite small in terms of ground area and is awkwardly shaped (basically it’s a small ground area but very tall).

I’d also be interested to see what the final seat design is. For their sake, my hope is that they’ve gone for an existing seat design from a large supplier, trimmed to an $ARVL spec. Seats are notoriously difficult to design due to safety constraints, and the ones in the video look unique to me.

**Conclusion:** It’s an odd mix of the back of a London Taxi without the passenger carrying capacity, and the external appearance of a slightly squashed 1980s Renault Espace. Unless they can sell them at a bizarrely high profit (>>100% COP), I suspect they’re heading down the wrong path with this one. Even with a high margin, volumes may well be limited to a few hundred units a year at most. They’ve said that the 2022 focus is on Bus and Van so resources on it may be limited.

**Van(s)**

There’s little information on the large van, and no published split between the sizes in pre-orders. In the car video (above) there is a large van with awkwardly small wheels, in the background. This could be it, done as an easter egg in the video, but I’m not entirely trusting that this hasn’t been staged to give some misleading information.

Electric vans in Europe which are over 4,250kg GVW require different driving license entitlements - the next license category goes up to 7,500kg GVW (that I know of, there’s no weight extension for EVs in this weight class). I would therefore expect this van to have a maximum of a 7,500kg GVW. At over 7,500kg, there aren’t really any “vans” in the market - they’re trucks of various sorts. There’s no other published information that I could find.

The smaller van has been through a major design iteration since it was first unveiled as a “Postman Pat” van in \~2019 (look it up if you’re not British). The latest version was shown in March 2021 and promises to have a Gross Vehicle Weight of minimum 3,500kg to max 4,250kg which makes it driveable in Europe on a car driving license. However, payload is a key driver for commercial vehicle sales. This varies from 567kg to 1,840kg depending on the configuration. That’s ahead of Ford’s ambition for the e-Transit.

Vehicle efficiency will affect the total range / payload - there’s not enough information available to conclude anything in this area.

The market for electric commercial vans in the EV 4,250kg category is undoubtedly increasing, but is still a limited market. 2020 sales of these e-Vans totalled around 8,000 units across the EU, UK and Norway.

Leader of the pack is Mercedes with the e-Vito (3,200kg GVW), who claimed only 2,318 sales in 2020. The second biggest selling van was the Mercedes e-Sprinter (3,500kg GVW) with 1,836 units.

If only 14% of the 56k van pre-orders are for the European 4.25T van, then they are poised to almost immediately take a >50% market share. But for that, they have to convert pre-orders into order contracts, and get production out quickly. Neither of these things is an easy thing to do with a new product and production process.

There is no pricing information available, but as with the Bus, they are saying that it is “equivalent to a diesel” van. The market leading diesel is the Ford Transit (>1500,000 annual sales) with prices from \~€20k. The pricing of the e-Vito starts from \~€49k, and the e-Sprinter from \~€66k. This gives $ARVL some significant margin to play with pricing and still undercut competitors for around 24 months after launch. There’s an expectation that electric vans will reach a price parity with diesels around 2024/5 - this is likely partly to come from price increases on the diesel vans, and price decreases on EVs, and depending on how it’s measured, any market dominance from $ARVL could also bring down the weighted average.

**Conclusion:** Looks good. Actually, very good. Entry timing into the market is about right to start making an impact before an inevitable explosion in market demand. Pricing for anything other than very large orders (which they’ve already got) being on a par with entry price diesels seems unlikely, with residuals becoming less of a concern for these orders. Thumbs up.

**Production**

4 vehicle assembly locations have been announced, along with 2 battery pack assembly facilities.

These are:

Rock Hill, SC, USA: Bus

West Charlotte, NC, USA: Vans + batteries

Bicester, UK: Vans

Madrid, Spain: Van(s)

There is also another Battery facility which is only stated to be in the UK. It would make sense for that to either be in Bicester or Banbury (where an R&D facility is). They’re only about 20 miles apart.

The production concept is to use small footprint “microfactories” and use robotic assembly cells to put vehicles together. This gives a low capex to set up a factory (they claim $43m), low opex and no specialist building required. $ARVL claim they can convert an existing warehouse type building into a functional assembly facility in 6 months, locating them close to where the customer demand is. They state that they could have “hundreds” of these facilities producing ""10s"" of platforms.

While this appears to be a very good idea for producing low volume vehicles and saving on transit costs, I have some concerns. Firstly, this seems like a supply chain nightmare. It’s difficult enough getting all the parts required into a single high volume car plant from all over the world in a cost effective way. But sending small amounts of parts from all over the world to hundreds of places, all over the world? That's not a task I'd fancy doing. It makes some sense to put together old-school KD kits in a central location to get around this problem.

Secondly, there is a startling lack of releases or meaningful updates about a working facility. The two which have been started for a while are over on both cost and time, with additional comments and implications that they’re struggling with it. “Production is difficult” as the company president said.

Yet they still make comments about wanting hundreds of these facilities, with 34 more planned by 2024. It would be extremely concerning if they start spending cash reserves on new facilities before they can demonstrably prove that the concept works as intended. As cheap as the microfactory concept is, it's likely still the biggest single capex on their books, and as few as 5 over the next 12 months would do major damage to their capital reserves if there is any sort of delay generating good revenue.

**Conclusion:** The microfactory model isn’t just a “nice to have”. It’s something which absolutely *has* to work for the company to succeed before they commit to more of them. In the short term, providing the vehicles are engineered and the supply chain set-up, they could at least turn to contract manufacturing if they have to, but this would significantly damage (my) confidence in the business.

**Financial**

Raised $660m by the SPAC on 24th March 2021

Cash on hand end Q1 (30th March): $516M

Cash on hand end Q2 (30th June): $445M

Cash on hand end Q3 (30th Sept): $380M

A subsequent bond and share offering was announced in the days following the Q3 report. This generated:

Green bonds: $200m

32.3m follow-on shares @ $9.50ea: $293m after expenses.

Best guess forecast for the Q4 report is cash on hand of $750m if no additional microfactory is started. Income from finance may substantially offset this.

**The Loan and an open question**

This is an open question because **I REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SHIT WORKS**. **Don’t take it as bad. Take it as my perpetually hungover brain being too smooth. Everything here could be entirely wrong or misleading. Don’t make any decisions based on this. You have been warned!**

On 14th May 2021 the owner of the company (and majority shareholder holding about 72% of the shares) announced that a $1.5bn loan had been arranged with Citibank, via Kinetik Finance, secured against 75.7m of the owner’s Arrival shares. Of those 75.7m shares, 35.5m shares appear to have been transferred to Citibank as collateral with the remaining shares being held by Kinetik to be transferred on demand. This appears to give a strike price on the loan of $19.8 per share (which was about the share price in May 2021)

In May 2021 the mkt cap was in the range of $11.5bn, making the loan around 13% of the business. However, the mkt cap is now around $4.8bn, meaning that the loan is now 31.2% of the business. Further to that, the loan documentation appears to say that although shares were put up as collateral, Citibank can have access to all of the company’s cash and assets as well. So how does this work for Citibank now? Even if they called in all of the 75.7m pledge shares that would still only give them less than $600m at the current share price - not to mention that daily trade volumes are only around 1.5m shares. How long are they likely to wait for before they call it in? Or is there another mechanism by which they can happily accept the current share price? Maybe the loan hasn’t been fully drawn down or the facility limited / closed?

2022-01-01 21:41:44,"AutoNation - Due DiligenceI've decided to make a once annual recommendation to you autists.

I mostly lurk but I've been here since y'all were in middle school. See my BWLD post below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k\_in\_long\_august\_puts\_for\_bwld/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k_in_long_august_puts_for_bwld/)

And here is my post last year regarding GoEasy.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd\_goeasy\_to\_the\_fucking\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd_goeasy_to_the_fucking_moon/)

My BWLD trade recommendation made 40% in 1 month from when I recommended it to when I closed the position.

My GoEasy trade is up 74% (including dividends) in the past 11 months from when I recommended it. I am still holding GoEasy.

Those are the only two recommendations I have made.

AutoNation will be my third.

In the spirit of the holiday season and seeing how you retards can't even beat the S&P500 (lmao), I've decided to make a charitable contribution to you all and share my next position: AutoNation.

AutoNation is America's largest retailer of new cars and has all the top legacy brands (Toyota, Ford, GM, Stellantis, Mercedez, Honda, etc.) in its New Car Dealership portfolio.

Due to the chip shortage, the prices of both used cars and new cars are up substantially. AutoNation's gross profit per New Vehicle is up 116% while their New retail units are down by 12% (!). They have run down their inventory from over 50 days worth of sales to now under 10 days. You can see this if you drive by any Car Dealership in the US. Despite this drop in units sold, AutoNation has hit record revenues this past year.

Catalyst 1: With the chip shortage abating, prices being sticky, and huge pent-up demand for personal automotive (who wants to sit on a bus or train with Covid?) we should see higher supply of cars and more units sold in 2022 at higher pricing. I expect record revenue again in 2022.

Autonation has also worked to reduce Selling, General, and Admin cost as a percentage of gross profit. They hit record low Selling, General, and Admin costs in both the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2021 and that has lead to 6 consecutive quarters of all-time record earnings.

With the new paradigm of tighter supply-demand in the automotive sector, the dealerships do not have to pay as much incentives to sales staff as the sales are much easier. Combined with the huge pent-up demand, this is catalyst 2.

Catalyst 2: Selling, General, and Admin Cost discipline has lead to 6 consecutive record quarters. With the new supply-demand environment, EPS should be supported at new higher level moving forward.

Catalyst 3: Buybacks. I love when a company buys back shares. This company is among the best at it. They reduced their shares outstanding 20% this year and they continue to increase the authorized buyback amount. This should support 20% higher EPS moving forward. The majority of the buyback was funded from Cash Flow from Operations and Cash on Hand.

Catalyst 4: They have acquired 2 companies this year worth an additional 4% in Revenue (and Earnings). Combined with Catalyst 3, this should boost earnings 24%+ moving forward.

Catalyst 5: Mike Manley is taking over as CEO. The guy who turned Jeep around and boosted sales over 100% is the new CEO. He left being the head of North American Operations of Stellantis to become the CEO of AutoNation. I think the market is undervaluing the transformation that we could see at AutoNation in the next few years.

Catalyst 6: Used Car sales. Under the AutoNation Brand, the company is planning to open 130 Used Car locations called AutoNation USA by 2026. As the used car market is 3x the sales of the New Car Market in the US and with such a strong brand, I anticipate them to be able to boost EPS quickly with each new store.

Catalyst 7: P/E Expansion. AutoNation currently trades at a 8 trailing P/E and a 6.5 forward P/E. For an overall market that is trading a historic highs, this is an anomaly.

Other used car dealers (CarMax has a P/E of 18) have higher P/E multiples as the used car market is more resilient to shocks (the used cars are already produced - don't need to worry about supply chain issues or chip shortages etc.)

If AutoNation can get a blended P/E of 12 with the introduction of Catalyst 6, it would support a share price that is almost double what it is now. Combined with the Catalyst 3 and 4, we could see EPS of $25/share in 2022. Multiplying by current P/E Ratio, that is $200 per share (71% increase). Multiplying by P/E Ratio of 12, that is $300 per share (156% increase)

2022-01-01 14:27:16,"Why Dry Bulk Shipping is going to be a big winner in 2022/2023. The sector is entering a multi-year super cycle.Hi everybody, happy New Year. This is my first DD so hopefully I can convey my points, and why my account is 100% invested in dry bulk stocks. I posted this a couple weeks ago, but wanted to rewrite it to fix some things.

&#x200B;

First, what is dry bulk shipping? Dry bulk shipping is the movement of commodities in bulk on ships. Coal, iron, grain, etc. are all popular commodities carried on these ships. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), is an index that tracks the cost of transporting these commodities. When the BDI is high, it means that dry bulk shippers are making lots of money because they are benefitting from the rise in transport costs.

&#x200B;

Historic levels of the Baltic Dry Index:

The BDI peaked in May of 2008, hitting 11440. It soon collapsed afterwards due to the global recession, reduced demand for shipping, and the market being flooded with new vessels. For the last decade, the BDI has been trading in a tight range from roughly 750-1500. However, in 2021 the BDI rallied hard as economies recovered from COVID-19 along with increased demand from countries other than China, hitting a peak of 5650 in October 2021. The BDI is currently at 2217, down from its peak in October due to China cutting steel production for the Winter Olympics.

&#x200B;

[Baltic Dry Index \(BDI\)](https://preview.redd.it/1xd2y7o123981.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe82d16c6b87fd99ac389cd0583f8e0e7606171)

One thing that many may be wondering is if the high rates we're seeing now are sustainable. I believe not only that they are, but that they will continue to go higher, even further than the peak we saw in October 2021. I'll explain my reasons why demand is looking very healthy for the next few years, and will continue to grow.

&#x200B;

In past years the BDI has largely been driven by China, and China only. This has changed in 2021, with a large portion of demand coming from countries such as Brazil and India. In fact, China has been slacking in demand this year due to strict COVID-19 restrictions, along with steel production limits so that they can have clear skies for the Winter Olympics. The limits will be lifted shortly after the Olympics, but what's important is that the BDI is maintaining decade high levels without China. When China reenters the picture sometime in March 2022, it could be the tipping point where demand outpaces supply.

&#x200B;

From Star Bulk Carriers Q3 2021 Earnings Transcript:

""And China basically wanted clear skies for the Olympic games. So it's a combination of clear skies and reduction of commodity prices from China. That's what their goal was. But let me make a side point here which I think is important. I was going through the imports of China earlier today and I realized that in the last 10 months of 2021, China actually imported 2 million tons less than last year. And you remember what we all used to say that if China sneezes, we will catch pneumonia -- the market will catch pneumonia. Well, China sneezed and we didn't catch exactly pneumonia. So I think that happened because the rest of the world came up."" -  Petros Pappas, CEO of Star Bulk Carriers answer when asked why rates are down from the October peak.

""This market that we've seen during 2021 has been without China being in the picture. And that in our view means that once China re-enters at some point next year, it will sow a much stronger market."" - Petros Pappas, final closing thoughts on the earnings call.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend reading the entire transcript, but these two quotes support my points above. The next thing I want to talk about is the supply situation, and the reasons why there will be very little fleet growth for the next few years.

&#x200B;

First, the shipping industry has been depressed for over a decade. The last time we saw a bull run in 2008, companies purchased a ton of vessels (which they later scrapped for metal), and then when the BDI collapsed, were stuck with useless vessels because there was no demand for them. It's highly unlikely that any company is going to want to take on the risk of substantially growing their fleet after what happened last time.

Secondly, even if companies do want to grow their fleet, it will be very hard too. This is because shipbuilding capacity is down hard since 2008, and there isn't the space to build these ships.

&#x200B;

[Orderbook for new vessels](https://preview.redd.it/0e9nd0sd23981.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=871dfbff694e855f622486a091a7b6d7ea028fe3)

In the last bull run, on average only 50 vessels were being delivered per year. If you look at today,  it's roughly the same, with future years sharing the same average. What's happening is there simply isn't enough space in the shipyards to build these vessels in mass quantity, and there won't be for quite a few years.

With 2022 and 2023 showing reluctance to take on new vessel orders, it's expected that capesize growth will only grow by 2.8%, and 1.6% overall for these two years. In short, not much is being added to the supply side for the next two years.

&#x200B;

Now that I've discussed the supply / demand side of things, and why it's looking quite favorable, I want to point out the actual companies.

Pretty much all dry bulk shippers follow the same chart pattern, and all are fair game, but I chose to go with Star Bulk Carriers ($SBLK).

&#x200B;

[$SBLK -1 year view, 155&#37; return](https://preview.redd.it/7p9ang0443981.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c630148e295c215b91a38202d6075dd5d17a69)

The stock pays a massive 22% annual dividend yield (although I don't expect the yield to stay this high as the stock will rise). I know you're probably thinking there is no way this is sustainable, but the good news is that Star Bulk has a dividend policy based on their cash flow.

The company is extremely undervalued also, even after 155% YTD returns. Analysts have price targets averaging $35, and it's currently been trading in a range from $18-$24 for the last 8 months. The tighter and longer the trading range, the bigger the breakout.

The company is very well managed, and is set to grow even if the BDI does not rally to record highs. Take a look at their debt and cash levels over the past two years. They have taken great advantage of the high rates seen in 2021, and have more cash than they did in 2008.

&#x200B;

[Slide 6 of Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/fuchdgfemb981.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=2544c07e2c6369dacd6ba61ca200b2b12bfc20c3)

Combining the dividends, the strengthening of the balance sheet, and the favorable supply/demand situation, $SBLK is a value investors dream. Oh, and did I mention the share buyback program? ([https://www.starbulk.com/media/uploads\_file/2021/08/06/p1fcc2uvdn1b3p19541tbo1kvbfat4.pdf](https://www.starbulk.com/media/uploads_file/2021/08/06/p1fcc2uvdn1b3p19541tbo1kvbfat4.pdf))

I think both shares and options can work well with this stock, you just have to pick which way you want to play it. It's a pretty safe play to buy the stock, collect dividends, and sell covered calls. On the other hand, I expect enough growth that LEAPs will generate high returns.

&#x200B;

My positions:

$SBLK Jan 2024 $25 calls (Yes, I know the spread is wide but I'm holding until expiration.)

&#x200B;

TLDR:

I am very bullish on the dry bulk sector for the next 2 years. The low vessel growth, combined with an increased demand for commodities will result in a favorable supply/demand situation, and dry bulk equities ($SBLK, $GOGL) will be making record profits. This isn't a sector much discussed on Reddit, but that's not a bad thing.

2022-01-01 08:18:38,"Behold the 3rd largest automaker!Rivian (RIVN) is a corporation damned to bankruptcy because it missed the boat on the electric vehicle adoption curve. This is because in the normal 2023 and early 2024 model years most traditional automakers will: have figured out how to make EV’s, and more importantly produce them at scale.

The bull case for disruptive tech companies in general is that they can build market share and profit margins based on that market share and product lock in. The problem is that the global auto industry is figuring out battery electric vehicles. This means that the future profit streams are going to be subject to the meat grinder called the global auto industry (one of the most competitive industries on earth)!

If battery electric vehicles are not successful due to the fundamental constraints of the technology, traditional auto makers have the legacy products continuing to make money and can sell electric vehicles as a niche product to improve cafe ratings!

But even more importantly; Rivian unlike Tesla (TSLA) does not have the time to develop their production capabilities, without normal automakers catching up on battery electric vehicle technology! So even if battery electric vehicles are the future: the fact is, that Rivian does not have the physical capital and know how to produce vehicles at scale. Tesla was inches away from bankruptcy, when Tesla was figuring out how to produce the Model 3! How much more so will Rivian be, when other auto manufacturers release their competing battery electric vehicles, (for example Honda’s (HMC) release of the Honda Prologue, which is most likely to be about the size of the Honda Pilot, or Acura MDX; or more importantly the Rivian R1S! And of course, Honda can produce a Ridgeline version of the Prologue to compete against the R1T.)

Unfortunately, Rivian has missed the boat. Have fun watching the stock return to her actual value! Or you can heed my warning and sell now for a great profit.

This is her form 10-Q. Looks like a company worthy of being the 3rd largest automaker!

2022-01-01 00:32:01,"$wish - Long position Reversal 2022The market tend to overshoot on on the long and short side. $Wish is one the most undervalued investment to take now. Most people will say they are losing revenu and market. 1) No Recent Tech IPO is profitable, they need money to grow and the IPO provide that money those high growth company needs. 2) Wish lost market share, howerver they are implementing a lot of correction before squeezing the ads for the whole entreprise to be profitable. Still, 90 millions users on a stock that is pretty much woth 1 Year of sale is insane, My Target is 30+ in 2022. 

Here is few takeaways after last earning call :

1) 3$ is truly the historical bottom

2) Wish will grow to be a much better profitable company, with better retentention

3) We will see significant quality upgrades on the products in 2022

4) Wish is making deals like there is no tomorrow with a lot of company

5) Ceo and founder stepped down without any fight …

 All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing 🧐. Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   “if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.”  To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming.. 
So let’s put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Reddit IPO - a few years ago I heard Shaq say that he doesn’t invest in companies he believes in, he invests in companies he USES…and that philosophy has worked out really well for him (especially his big Google purchase). 

With that shared, I’m thinking of making a big investment in Reddit. I think Reddit has the ability to go ALL the way. 

However, as a MEMBER and serious considering INVESTOR - here are my concerns (also happy to hear everyone else’s thoughts and concerns on this topic):

- When Reddit becomes an IPO is it subject to more oversight? One of the things that I love about Reddit is it’s open market style - from Wall Street Bets convos, to OnlyFans & prostitution channels, info on replica gear, and honest on anything we can imagine. Will that be lost? How might censorship play a role in Reddit becoming an IPO? Could that lead to the death of Reddit from a user perspective? Might users be required to reveal more of their private information? Will our data and conversations be sold or used against us? 

These are big picture concerns for me. If Reddit is able to survive as it does in this current moment, I think it has the opportunity to be HUGE and worth a Wall Streets Bets rally.

This made me interested in why she would go long right now. I discovered the CHIPS and FABS acts, which are both set to strengthen the US semiconductor industry. [Here is the summary.](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/)

The US needs more microchips. These acts are designed to bring manufacturing back to the US. The companies receiving benefits will flourish. Here's how we make money off this:

**1) Safest option:** Buy SMH. This ETF captures the whole semiconductor industry in one shot.

**2) Next riskiest:** Buy META ETF, not to be confused with Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. META captures a bunch of metaverse stocks that will benefit from better and cheaper chips. Soon, we will have a zombie slayer augmented reality game and this will take off.

**3) Buy SOXL.** This is the 3x-leveraged version of SMH. You get the whole industry, but 3x exposure to it gives you bigger gains. And since CHIPS and FABS will boost the whole industry, we shouldn't have to worry about 3x on the downside.

**4) Buy individual stocks like Nancy.** Nancy went long on MU and RBLX among others. I am partial to LRCX. LRCX is one of only 3 companies that makes the machines that other companies need to make chips. All the companies that want to build fabrication facilities in the US will go through LRCX and boost sales big time.

🚀 because you guys don't read anything without a rocket.

Positions: 103 shares of LRCX, 108 SMH, 18 SOXL, 16 AMD, 489 QQQ, and 699 TQQQ.

I work in healthcare, and I've been taking emergency covid gigs since Fauci and Xi's lovechild ran away from home and the world developed a mask fetish. My latest gig is at a monoclonal antibody Infusion clinic. This shit is the tits, it's arguably the only thing that for sure knocks covid on its ass. Trump, Joe Rogan, and your wife's boyfriend all got it when they got COVID and recovered in just a few days meanwhile you still have a persistent cough and your sperm count is dwindling.

We give several different brands of antibody at this clinic,, but the only one that's effective against omicron so far is Sotrovimab, made by $VIR and $GSK. Guess what? We have a shortage of Sotro, and it's actually due to a shortage on a federal level. 

Just a month and a half ago, the days were moving slowly, barely any patients coming through the clinic. This gave me plenty of time to browse loss porn and play $SPY FDs, until one day Thanksgiving happened and grandmas everywhere got full on turkey and omicron. Overnight we went from 30 to 150+ patients a day, and there's only one antibody that works for most of these people. Fast forward to NYE, and in the last week testing sites have filled up, and some states have activated the National Guard to work in hospitals. 

The demand for Sotro is massive and growing, the federal government already signed a $2100/dose, $1b deal with $GSK & $VIR in 2021. Some hospital systems are halting the use of $LLY's and $REGN's antibodies altogether. To put icing on the cake, data on the in-development intramuscular (IM) version of sotro is underway and looking positive. This will be much easier to produce and distribute at a massive scale, and cut down administration time from a 30-minute IV Infusion to a quick jab, which is more convenient for the patient and saves on labor costs (sucks for me).

$VIR is only a $5b company. With $GSK at a $111b market cap, $VIR has much deeper value. The only detail I have been unable to find is the agreement between $GSK and $VIR regarding profit splits of Sotro, and I imagine $VIR's next earnings release will illuminate that much more. Regardless, this is looking bullish AF. Best way to play is to buy shares, and literally any calls you want.

https://preview.redd.it/rry7t3ppyw881.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=60778f9a36c935d2a3d6d1be428ecc83bbb110f7

 

* ITM Depthness
   * I calculated the ITM Depthness by taking 1-Strike Price/Purchase Price , *i.e* the distance as a percentage from price level at the time of purchase to the strike price. 
   * From this quantification, it can almost be seen as a personal risk tolerance level due to the nature of ITM calls. ITM call options hold the property of being made almost entirely from intrinsic value making it a very safe bet as it’s trading almost in parity to it’s shares. This means over time, it won’t decay as much as ATM or OTM calls would. dITM (deep in the money) calls have protection against a down turn in the mid term(to reasonable levels), an inaccurate growth projection, still will retain some value at exp if it’s near the break even point and in the event that it hits/exceeds your growth projection, you are leveraged out the ass.
   * From the data, we can see that MU and RBLX have two notable levels. MU was purchased ATM while MU was purchased very dITM. Pelosi is basically saying she is less confident in the growth projection of MU or at least hedging in the event of a mid term down turn so is decreasing her risk by buying very dITM. In the case of RBLX, she is increasing her risk by buying ATM which has less intrinsic value and more extrinsic value which is speculative in nature. This means she is either being highly aggressive or is more confident in the growth projection of RBLX. It’s important to note that with the RBLX position only being 10% of her total transaction, this might be more of a speculative bet rather than sincere  confidence. 
   * In the case of CRM, GOOG and DIS, she is still ITM but at a much higher transaction weight. This can be seen as a more confident long term bet but still hedging the downward scenarios. 

 

* P/L Matrix Scenario
   * I’ve simulated some P/L scenario in this matrix
   * The percentages in the first row are represented of the distance between the price at expiration and the corresponding options break even price. 
   * P/L is calculated by (#contracts\*100)(break even price(1+ %delta)-strike price)-trans total
   * So in the case of GOOG, if at exp it is -30% away from pelosi’s break even price ($2990) her options would have a value of (10\*100)(2990(.7)-2000)-990000

https://preview.redd.it/9z578932zw881.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08e97f73ded2132d3caa9c0c6255bd2d06d1066

* Lets say at exp the market is in a recession, economic downturn, tech correction, etc and is -30% away from her break even prices. She’ll have 10% left of her investment. Pretty fat loss for most people, but based off of Pelosi’s net worth this trade is only 2% of her net worth. This is basically insignificant to her. This is important to put to scale so people take less stock in the absolute fact of her knowing something vs this just being a gamble. This can very well just be a gamble, but seeing Pelosi’s history she probably knows something.
* Meta Theory
* One thing these stocks all have in common is their relevance to the Metaverse. They all are big into the future of the metaverse. Is pelosi betting on the Metaverse being the future? If so, why would she not be buying calls on META(FaceBook) or Unity? Does she have inside info on the future of the Metaverse? Or possibly information on the future of META or Unity which prevented her from buying calls on them? Besides her, who knows. 
* Conclusion
* I would like to dive deeper into her other holdings to hopefully build a better picture of why she picked these stocks in particular. For instance, NVDA would also be a big bet in the metaverse but she already owns calls for the same exp as GOOG, MU and DIS but at a larger trans weight. Is this just a metaverse play? Does she have inside info? Can diving deeper possibly answer these questions? I guess we will see.",0.1357347670250896,3986,675

2021-12-31 17:33:53,"PSFE (Paysafe) Strong 100% - 200% Play From HereTo call Paysafe stock a disappointment in 2021 would be an extreme understatement. While some aspects of the business performed well, new gambling restrictions in Germany which basically cut out the entire market was a major blow to Paysafe's revenue.

This resulted in a very bad miss on Q3 and a complete revision of their 2022 outlook which resulted in the stock dropping by over 50%.

However, sometimes chaos creates opportunity.

1st - Paysafe was way oversold on the bad news and is now trading at just 2X revenue. They do have more debt on the books than I'd like to see but they have ample Free Cash Flow and have been improving their margins each quarter with cost savings measures. They are not in any imminent danger of not being able to repay their debt or needing to do an offering to handle it.

2nd - The biggest impact to Paysafe in 2021 was losing the entre German gambling market which was by far the largest in Europe. Paysafe did a very poor job of explaining to investors how much revenue they brought in from Germany and therefore many were blindsided at the impact the regulations took.

However, an important distinction needs to be made between loosing market share to competitors and having a government remove a market from all players.

The incoming German chancellor is much more open to online gambling and of course many government officials are chomping at the bit to generate the income gambling taxes provide. At some point within the next 1 - 2 years it seems likely Germany will once again be a major player in online gambling and Paysafe is in a prime position to benefit greatly once that happens.

3rd - Their Digital Wallet (particularly hit hard by the German gambling laws) is at best an ok product right now. They do some things great, somethings quite poorly. They were able to ride on what they had because the European and in particular German gambling market kept it prompt up as it was very gambling focused.

With Germany at least temporarily removed from the equation, they have to find a way to grow it without them and that is where Chirag Patel comes in as the new CEO for the Digital Wallet.

You can learn more about Chirag here https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/about/leadership/meet-our-leaders/chirag-patel/ or track him down on some podcasting interviews he has done but the short of it is he comes from Amazon and Santander Group with an outstanding track record of growth.

I believe with his customer 1st centric approach and track record of success he will turn Paysafe's digital wallet around and we will start to see the benefits of that in Q3, 2022.

4th - Paysafe has two unannounced partnerships which will be revealed in Q1, 2022 that are very exciting. The first is a new gambling partnership which has been teased as a steal of a major player from a competitor to do full payment processing for.

We also know this gambling entity has some sort of brick and mortar presence and they want to convert their brick and mortar visitors to paying on their app while in the casino instead of paying with cash.

MGM, Caesars, Penn are of the first names which come to mind as strong possibilities, any one of which would be a major win both in terms of top line growth and the ability to steal away more major players from the competition.

Secondly there is an unannounced digital currency deal which I have some theories on what it may be but at this point it is pure speculation on my part from connecting dots which certainly holds some merit but as in the end there may be nothing there.

However, Paysafe is a large player in digital currency and does processing for many digital currency companies behind the scenes and they are touting this deal as ""major"" which we have not seen them say in the past so it seems logical that whatever this deal is, it's far bigger than something like the Coinbase/Visa deal they were a part of.

5th - While there other areas I could point out for strong growth coming in the later half of 2022 which I believe may catapult their stock higher than what I'm suggesting in this article, I want to stay moderate in the projections here and leave all hyperbole on the sideline.

Paysafe took a reset on their full year 2022 predictions and basically said at this point we expect to do in '22 what we had hoped to do in '21.

Well, it was over $12 a share on June 30th before the concerns of the coming Q3 ER started seeping in.

So if they just hit their bare bones projections (which they have already said they lowered as much as they did to ensure there was next to no chance they had another miss) it would make sense that by Q3 of '22 they are right back to where they left off at in June stock price wise, since they will be in the exact same position in terms of revenue growth.

After having re-listened to the Q3 ER call several times, reading through the twitter messages from Izzy their CFO, having re-listened to their CEO speak at the Cannae conference in December multiple times AND the fact that there was a strong wave of insider buying between Nov 12th - Dec 3rd, I believe Paysafe is going to easily meet all projections and strongly beat some of them over the next 3 quarters.

There is no logical conclusion one can come to that this stock will not be back above $8 come the Q3 ER if they do so and the risk at this point if there is more stumbling blocks along the way have been mostly mitigated by the fact they are already trading at a mere 2X revenue while maintaining strong Free Cash Flow.

In Conclusion - Paysafe is now a low risk, high reward play with a strong possibility to double to $8 or even triple to $12 within 1 year from it's current $4 price point.

**Best Case:** he has legitimately 'invested' his millions into something before it climbs.  His millions drive up the price, volume & attention attracting more yahoo-finance fish to chase his action, who drive up price & volume more.  He goes on TV and barks about what he just invested in.  Then slack-jaw TV watchers chase the play, driving up price and volume.  More tards follow the play because of the TV-watcher's added volume.  Then Jimbo sees how high it has gotten and backs out of the trade, taking a few million in 'free' gains while freeing his principle to hit his next target.  Rinse & repeat...

I remember something involving dumping after you pump, maybe... 

And that's the best case.

**Worst (Most Likely) Case:** he's doing this shit deliberately, talking out both sides of his mouth, and capitalizing on the natural market rotations he is deliberately exacerbating with his pump & dump.  This is unfortunately the most likely case given his actions.  He talks up his & his buddies' plays and then they all take their principle & some portion of the gains off the table.  He talks about how great the economy is on his show and the news, and then turns around and posts shit like this.  All the while they laugh their way into clubs where martinis cost more than my combined net worth.

**The Good News:** he is getting called out for it now.

Someone smarter & with more time than I can probably calculate when he makes his predictions, and how long it takes for things to crest after those predictions, then play the options on the average fall from the prediction's high.

2021-12-31 16:01:45,"eVTOL SPACs are ripe for putsGood morning degenerates and happy almost New Year. I’ll start by attempting to save your time by referring you to [this video](https://youtu.be/a717YZnhQ-s). Given how few of you can read (I just learned last week!), I’m assuming / hoping that you just clicked on the link, however, I’ll continue a written explanation of my investment thesis for those with wrinkled brains. Today I bring to you an opportunity to short some of the most wildly overvalued securities in the stock market, eVTOL SPACs. JOBY, LILM, ACHR and EVTL are all attempting to gain first mover advantage in what is now being called the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market. The idea is that in the coming decades, there will be a growing demand for vertical transport within or even between nearby cities that can be fulfilled using electric tiltrotors. The valuation for this market as a whole is being given enormous estimates, with some even speculating that UAM will be worth trillions within two decades. As a tiltrotor pilot myself (I fly MV-22s in the US Marine Corps) I find the idea incredibly fascinating, and of course I’m intrigued by the idea that such an industry could provide job opportunities for me in the future. However, I’m also a realist, and the promising timelines that these companies are suggesting are eyebrow raising to say the least. Joby, for instance, claims that they will be generating billions of dollars in revenue by 2025. Currently, their aircraft has not been FAA certified, there’s no existing vertiport infrastructure and there’s been almost no discussion on what the airspace deconfliction will look like with hundreds, if not thousands, of these things flying through already heavily congested airspace. The FAA certification piece alone is a massive hurdle to overcome. Look at the AW609, a “conventional,” gas-powered tiltrotor. It’s been seeking FAA certification for over a decade. The FAA will be extremely cautious (rightfully so) in evaluating what is essentially an experimental aircraft that is electrically powered for commercial use. Bottom line is that there will be delays in this process. Meanwhile, Joby is currently valued at ~4.5 billion, or roughly the same as Jet Blue, a profitable commercial airline with a fleet of FAA certified aircraft. Even if you believe in Joby’s incredibly ambitious timeline, this valuation is preposterous, and it’s market cap will almost certainly slip as it endures quarter after quarter of insane cash burn while working toward certification. And moreover, even if you once again trust that they will succeed in achieving timely certification, do you really believe that they’ll immediately start raking in billions in revenue? Imho, no shot. Just look at how long it took for Uber to achieve profitability. While the business models slightly differ, I think it’s fair to say that eVTOLs will need at least as much time as ride sharing before gaining anything close to mass adoption. I’ll end by saying that while I don’t have any specific trading strategies to share, my recommendation (not financial advice) would be to go short on these companies or at the very least don’t go long. Everyone loves the idea of flying cars, and I’ll admit that the glossy videos and pictures that these companies plaster all over social media are eye-catching and imaginative. However, the UAM concept as a whole is extremely speculative and requires years and massive amounts of capital expenditure prior to anyone being able to safely say that this will make money. To me, It’s very similar to the idea of the supersonic passenger jet that was attempted in the late 90s / early 2000s: cool af on paper, wildly impractical due to current technological limitations (in this case battery weight / endurance) in RL. Now, if you haven’t already, watch the video linked at the beginning of the post. Paul Bertorelli does a much better job than me explaining the potential pitfalls for those currently hoping to capitalize on the UAM concept. Hoping this post is helpful or at least generates some discussion. Cheers.",0.0739596646739504,4085,673

As I'm falling, I click my chronograph start pusher to count my descent.

I am located in Germany so my idea would be to invest in American and Russian defense companies.

2021-12-31 07:44:23,"Last night and this morning: U.S. stocks dive late in the day! Chinese stocks bucked the trend and soared----For sharing**Overseas Markets**

1. U.S. stocks late dive! Dow down 0.25% to halt six-game winning streak

The three major U.S. stock indices opened lower, the S&P and Nasdaq turned lower in the last few minutes of Thursday's trading session, and the Dow Jones also ended its six-game winning streak. By the close of trading, the Dow Jones fell 0.25%, the S&P 500 fell 0.30%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.16%.

The performance of large U.S. technology stocks was not satisfactory. Sorted by market cap, Apple fell 0.66%, Microsoft fell 0.77%, Google A fell 0.34%, Amazon fell 0.33%, Tesla fell 1.46%, Nvidia fell 1.38%, and only Meta rose 0.41%.

Usually, U.S. stocks will rise in the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year, a phenomenon known as the ""Christmas market. The lower-than-average trading volume, combined with the fact that many investors are closed for the holidays, can lead to increased trading volatility. Some companies are also adjusting their portfolios at the end of the year.

2. The popular Chinese stocks closed Thursday's big rise highway up more than 21%

Popular Chinese stocks closed up sharply on Thursday, with Gao Tou, Ai Qi Yi and Beili Beili leading the way; the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closed up 9.40%, the biggest one-day gain since 2008.

Highway rose more than 21%, Akiyip and AutoChina rose more than 13%, Beili Beili, Vipshop and Shell rose more than 12%, Alibaba and Funhead rose more than 9%, and NetEase rose nearly 9%.

New energy car stocks, Azera car rose more than 14%, Xiaopeng car rose nearly 10%, ideal car rose more than 8%.

3. The main index of European shares rose 

Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 0.19%, France's CAC 40 index rose 0.16%, the European Stoxx 50 index rose 0.50%.

4. Thursday U.S. oil closed 0.6% higher, approaching $ 77 per barrel

U.S. crude oil futures prices closed higher on Thursday. Oil prices were supported by easing market concerns that the mutated strain of Omicron is hampering economic recovery and signs that crude oil inventories are falling.

On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for February delivery rose 43 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $76.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on the Intercontinental Exchange in London rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to close at $79.32 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures have risen for four consecutive trading days so far.

5. Thursday gold futures closed 0.5% higher

Gold futures prices closed higher on Thursday despite a stabilizing dollar and higher U.S. stocks.

Investors believe the Omicron mutant strain is less of a threat to economic growth, pushing the dollar to stabilize on Thursday and U.S. stocks to climb, pushing the Dow and S&P 500 to new intraday highs.

6. Year-end U.S. unemployment benefits data released Gold rises U.S. bonds fell

U.S. first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that despite the outbreak of a new round of epidemics, but labor demand is still strong.

Data from the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday showed that in the week ended Dec. 25, the number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000, down 8,000 from the revised level in the previous cycle. The median estimate of economists surveyed was 206,000.

**International Macro**

1. The founder of Bridgewater Dalio: the Fed may raise interest rates 4-5 times next year, which will be a sensitive issue

Rui Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in an exclusive interview that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates 4-5 times next year until it negatively affects the stock market.

Regarding the current inflationary pressure, Dalio pointed out that the U.S. now has two types of inflation: a cyclical inflation that occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds production capacity, and a monetary inflation caused by the over-issuance of money and credit.

For the second type of inflation, he warned that if cash and bond holders were to sell these assets in a big way, the central bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace or keep them low by printing money and buying financial assets, and this would exacerbate inflation. This adds difficulty to the Fed's policy making.

2. The United States CDC: regardless of vaccination or not, people should avoid cruise travel

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday advised people not to travel on cruise ships, regardless of their vaccination status, as the Omicron variant swept the world with a recent sharp increase in new positive crown cases.

The CDC raised its travel advisory for cruise ships to the highest level. The agency is currently investigating or observing dozens of cruise ships with New Crown outbreaks.

The CDC warns that the New Crown virus is easily spread from person to person in close proximity on board ships and that the chances of contracting the virus on a cruise ship are very high, even with New Crown vaccinations and booster shots.

3. U.S. Cancellations Exceed 1,000 Again as Chaotic Holiday Travel Season Continues

The number of flight cancellations by U.S. airlines is still growing, with another 1,170 flights cancelled Thursday as a surge in coronavirus cases leads to severe understaffing. And the forecasted snowstorm could further disrupt travel during the New Year's holiday.

According to [FlightAware.com](https://FlightAware.com), JetBlue canceled 175 flights, or 17 percent of its scheduled flights, as of 2:27 p.m. New York time Thursday. Allegiant canceled 93 flights, or 18 percent of its scheduled flights. United Airlines canceled 197, or 9 percent of its schedule. By noon, the number of flights canceled for the day had surpassed the 1,084 canceled for the entire day on Wednesday.

This comes on the heels of thousands of U.S. flight cancellations over the Christmas weekend and into the early part of the week due to winter storms coupled with staffing shortages.

4. U.S. first-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, highlighting that labor demand is still strong

The number of first-time jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, indicating that labor demand is still strong despite the new outbreak of the epidemic.

The number of first-time jobless claims totaled 198,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, down 8,000 from a revised level in the previous cycle, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 206,000.

The number of continuing claims for unemployment benefits fell to 1.72 million in the week ended Dec. 18, the lowest since March last year.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Sumant Kulkarni maintained a ""buy"" rating on Biogen ([BIIB.US](https://BIIB.US)) with a price target of $390.

Earlier, South Korean media reported that Samsung Group was in talks to buy Biogen, saying it was valued at about $42 billion. Subsequently, Samsung Bio, a subsidiary of Samsung, said these were untrue information.

Some Amazon employees reportedly complained recently that it was difficult for them to get compensation and leave after being injured on the job.

2021-12-31 06:53:17,"2021 Option Trading of Li AutoI traded covered call and cash-secured put options of Li Auto throughout year 2021 and here are the results in one chart. This was my first year to actively trade options and wanted to see how it looks on a chart. Did not try any multi-legged strategies, just simple covered calls and puts.

All in all made 30% annual return, could have made little bit more but missed some trading opportunities.

Sold calls and puts 13 times, options expired worthless 7 times, got assigned twice, bought to cover thrice and did actual stock trading a few times. Overall Li remained range-bound most of the year but was able to generate some income over original about $3000 investment.

Between March to July the stock was down and the trade was in deep red but didn't sell the underlying security and eventually the stock recovered to the cost-basis. Only strategy I made sure was not to have the strike price below the cost-basis while selling calls.

2021-12-31 06:25:33,"Cassava sciences and its upcoming moon 🚀 

https://preview.redd.it/d5g9pak1ht881.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=fde8984cbf9cd5bad15cf8cce400a3527558d38f

TLDR: $Sava (Cassava Sciences) is a company that's developing a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. It currently is in phase 3 of its clinical trials and is having better results than any other Alzheimers drug known to man. It is also at a perfect buying opportunity of $40-45 down from highs of 140 back in July and is getting significantly less risky day by day. Keep reading and ill explain everything further.

**So why does all this matter?** Well, Alzheimer's disease currently has NO effective treatment and there are about 6 million people suffering from it in the US alone and many more internationally. It is also the 5th leading cause of death in people aged 65 and older. If you're not familiar Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to die. This often causes many symptoms such as memory loss, poor judgment, taking longer to complete tasks, wandering/getting lost, inability to learn new things, hallucinations, paranoia, and eventually death. There are many more symptoms of Althzhiemers however if I listed them here it would get far too long. If you have loved one or have known anyone with Alzheimer's you've probably witnessed many of these yourself and know how difficult it is for everyone involved luckily there are some people in this world who are trying to find effective treatments and even cures for such a terrible disease. and Cassava Sciences is one of those groups of people.

**First off: why is sava so low if just less than a year ago it was at 140?** Well in august of 2021 Jordan Thomas, a lawyer who later revealed he was representing clients with short positions in sava, submitted a citizens petition to the FDA calling to HALT the development of the drug due to ""safety concerns"". The citizen's petition caused the stock to drop 55% over the next 3 days. After the dust cleared many experts including cassava sciences its self have stated that the claims were biased and completely fake. The stock then stayed around $40-50 for a good while until, on November 1st, The Journal of Neuroscience stated that it found no evidence of data manipulation and it supported Simufilam as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. This led to a stellar 2x rally from levels of $46 on November 1 to $91 on November 5 in SAVA stock. ([https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/review-journal-neuroscience-shows-no-evidence-data-manipulation](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/review-journal-neuroscience-shows-no-evidence-data-manipulation))

However, the stock was quickly pulled back down by short-sellers who currently and continuously held it at about 30% short interest on the stock. As you can see with just one independent journal releasing a statement saying there's no evidence of data manipulation the stock doubled, so imaging what it will do when the FDA rejects the citizen's petition or news drops that sava has applied for breakthrough therapy designation or even better the FDA gives sava the green light for their drug. So if you missed out the first time now you have a second chance to get in SAVA and hold before it's too late.

**Some catalysts.**

https://preview.redd.it/6gnfe89mit881.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a514242679eb572eacf31577fb3eceec5c926f5

One major and upcoming catalyst is the FDA deadline of the citizen's petition. The FDA has 150 days to respond to a citizen's petition. The one filed against sava was on August 23, 2021, so it will need a response by January 19, 2022. An FDA rejection of the citizen's petition will logically set sava back on track to its pre-FUD price of 100-150.

**Price targets.** Long-term: This is assuming Cassava sciences gets their drug approved and everything goes well. let's be conservative and say SAVA captures 1/4 of just the US market at $20,000 per patient would put sava at stock price at about 675 and that's just my estimate. I have seen price targets for sava upon drug approval at anywhere from 300 - 3700 so your guess is honestly as good as mine, at any rate, it's still a hell of a lot higher than 45.

Short term: with the citizen's petition response deadline coming ever closer I could see sava easily reaching 100+ within the next few months it all depends on how firmly the FDA responds to the citizen's petition. if they flat out reject it and publicly tear it to pieces I can easily see the price going 200+

Ultimately Cassava sciences is the best bet we as humanity have for treating Alzheimer's currently. Personally, I believe that we are near the end of the shorting of this stock and will soon see a huge inflow of new investors that will send the stock to new all-time highs especially after the upcoming citizen's petition dismissal. I would highly recommend you look into the company and its research further I've provided helpful links down below as well as a link to a cassava sciences discord server if you would like to get more information there.",0.10949494949494949,5167,818
